## Introducing Stanwell Moor Brew

Step into The Anchor, where tradition meets innovation right in the heart of Stanwell Moor Village. We're excited to introduce our latest addition to our bar—Stanwell Moor Brew, a craft beer that epitomises the spirit of artisan brewing. This exceptional brew has been developed in collaboration with Greene King and their partners, ensuring a product that delights both casual drinkers and beer aficionados alike.

  

## Crafted with Excellence

Stanwell Moor Brew is a testament to the art of beer making, brewed in the historic town of Dunbar, Scotland, by skilled artisans who are passionate about quality. Utilising traditional brewing methods, this beer features a pale straw colour and is crafted from lager malt with Challenger and Northdown hops, giving it a subtle fresh hop flavour. The result is a clean, crisp taste with a refreshing finish and no lingering aftertaste, perfect for any occasion.

  

### A Taste Like No Other

Our Stanwell Moor Brew offers a refreshing crispness that makes it incredibly drinkable and enjoyable. Its light body and subtle flavours make it a perfect match for a variety of dishes from our menu, particularly complementing our classic fish and chips or a light salad. It's a beer designed to enhance your meal without overwhelming your palate.
