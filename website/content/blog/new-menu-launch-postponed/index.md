We are very sorry to announce that, due to a last minute change in staffing, we've been forced to push the launch of the new menu's at The Anchor to June 2019, instead of from next week.

  

We've not made the change lightly but have always been clear that our goals here are to consistently deliver outstanding quality products and services. The changes put our ability to deliver consistently at risk and we cannot deliver anything except the best to you all.

  

We are working quickly to ensure that our Sunday lunch service remains consistent and high quality but will communicate the dates when the new menu will be available.

  

We thank you all for your continued support, if you have any questions about the changes, please don't hesitate to let me know, either by stopping in or by calling on 01753682707.

  

Many thanks,

  

Billy
