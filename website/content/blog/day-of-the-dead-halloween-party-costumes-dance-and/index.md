The Anchor’s Day of the Dead Halloween Party on Saturday, November 2nd, 2024, brought together our local community for a night to remember. This lively event was the grand finale of our month-long celebration dedicated to the Day of the Dead, filled with themed events and gatherings that embraced our pub’s spirit of inclusivity, festivity, and connection.

With everyone from family groups to old friends joining in, the event was the perfect mix of fun, music, and vibrant energy. Let’s relive the highlights of this memorable night and celebrate all the ways we came together for an unforgettable Halloween at The Anchor!

  

## **Celebrating the Day of the Dead Halloween Party at The Anchor**

Our Day of the Dead Halloween Party combined the best of both worlds—spooky Halloween vibes with the colourful traditions of Día de Muertos. Guests turned up in fancy dress, showcasing incredible costumes that ranged from spine-chilling ghosts to the dazzling, intricate designs of traditional sugar skull face paint.

  

The Anchor welcomed everyone, from young families to groups of friends, and even those who decided to pop in alone to enjoy the atmosphere and join the fun. It was a true testament to our community’s spirit—everyone felt at home, and the pub buzzed with excitement and laughter. The costumes added an extra layer of flair, making it a fantastic visual celebration of creativity, with everyone getting into the spirit of the night.

  

## **Fancy Dress, Festive Fun, and Spirited Competition**

The night’s fancy dress competition brought out the best and boldest in costume creativity. With categories for Best Costume, Most Creative Costume, and Best Face Paint, guests eagerly showcased their unique interpretations of Halloween and Day of the Dead attire. From skeleton costumes that glowed in the dark to meticulously painted faces capturing Día de Muertos artistry, each attendee added their flair to the evening.

  

Even without a professional face painter, our guests impressed with their DIY skills, and the winners walked away with pride (and a few fun prizes!). This competition captured the essence of our event—a blend of fun, community, and creativity.

## Dancing, Drinks, and Shot Paddles

As the evening rolled on, the dance floor came alive with the beats of our live DJ, who kept the music flowing from 8 pm to 1 am. The energy was electric, with people dancing, laughing, and letting loose on the floor. This celebration wasn’t just about music; it was about everyone coming together, from strangers to neighbours, to enjoy an evening filled with joy and freedom.

  

The bar was bustling with excitement as guests enjoyed our popular shot paddles, perfect for sharing with friends and keeping the night’s energy high. This selection of shots added a fun element to the evening, with everyone toasting and celebrating together.

Throughout the night, guests could fuel up with delicious late-night bites, including takeaway-style burgers that added to the laid-back, fun vibe of the celebration. This kept spirits high and ensured everyone had the energy to dance until the very last song!

  

## **A Month of Festivities Leading to the Grand Finale**

The Day of the Dead Halloween Party was the closing event in a month filled with fun, themed gatherings that brought people together at The Anchor. Each event added its unique twist, building anticipation for the big night on November 2nd. Here’s a quick look back at our October highlights:

*   **Quiz Night:** On October 9th, we kicked off with a Halloween-themed Quiz Night, hosted by the ever-entertaining Nish. Teams competed on spooky trivia, and friends enjoyed the first of many nights celebrating the season together.
    
*   **Tequila Tasting Night:** Friday, October 18th was all about flavour and culture with our Día de Muertos-themed Tequila Tasting Night. Guests explored premium tequila selections, enjoyed a taco meal, and dived into the traditions of Day of the Dead through cocktails, quizzes, and engaging videos.
    
*   **Gameshow House Party:** On October 30th, we hosted a Gameshow House Party: Snatch Phrase Edition! With drag bingo, Play Your Cards Right, and The Price Is Right, hosted by the fabulous Nikki Manfadge, it was an evening of laughter, games, and inclusive fun.
    

  

Each event brought our community together and gave everyone a reason to join the celebration, building the excitement and momentum that led to our incredible Day of the Dead Halloween Party.
