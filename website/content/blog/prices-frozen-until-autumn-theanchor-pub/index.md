When everything around us keeps going up—from your weekly shop to a pint at the pub—we’re doing something different at The Anchor. We’ve made the decision to keep our **prices frozen until autumn** 2025. That means no draught price increases and a summer full of solid value, brilliant drinks, and welcoming community vibes.

  

This isn’t a gimmick or a flash sale. It’s a promise. Because at The Anchor, we believe in looking after our own.

  

## Why We’re Keeping Prices Frozen Until Autumn

### Community First, Always

We know the pressure people are under right now. That’s why we’ve chosen to **hold our draught prices at their April 2024 rate**—with no increases planned until autumn 2025. Whether you’re popping in after work, meeting friends for a quiz night, or sharing dinner with the family, **we’re keeping things fair and accessible** for everyone in the village.

  

It’s not about being the cheapest. It’s about being a pub you can count on.

  

### Built on Real Partnership

Thanks to our strong relationship with [Greene King](https://www.greeneking.co.uk/), we’re able to offer **great products at fair prices**. Being a tied pub can have its challenges, but this partnership means we can **introduce value where it matters most**—and that’s exactly what we’re doing with new drinks and deals.
