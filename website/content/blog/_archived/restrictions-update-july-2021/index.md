Following the Prime Ministers announcement today, we are pleased to hear that the plan is to progress with 'Freedom Day', allowing us hopefully to remove social distancing, enforced masks and table service from this coming Monday, July 19th 2021.

  

As he said as a part of his announcement, masks are still recommended, and many of our customers may still wear them to feel safe and secure.

  

We will provide updates once the formal changes have been passed and restrictions confirmed. We look forward to continuing grow The Anchor with the support of all of you, as the local community.

  

Thank you and stay safe.

  

Billy.
