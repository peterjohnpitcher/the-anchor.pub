## **Gameshow House Party Success: Snatch Phrase Edition at The Anchor**

The Anchor’s Gameshow House Party on 30 October brought locals, friends, and family together for an evening of laughter, nostalgia, and community. The sold-out event, themed "Snatch Phrase," proved yet again that there’s nothing quite like these nights in West London. With classic games reimagined and a crowd that couldn't resist getting involved, the night was truly unforgettable. This gathering wasn't just about fun and games; it exemplified The Anchor’s mission to foster connections and create lasting memories for the Stanwell Moor community.

  

## **A Night of Nostalgia and Fun**

With every ticket sold, the crowd at The Anchor buzzed with excitement. The Snatch Phrase Gameshow House Party gave a delightful twist to a beloved classic game, sending attendees on a fun trip down memory lane. This event wasn’t just for participants; onlookers joined in the laughter, their cheers and reactions filling the pub as guests immersed themselves in the action.

  

The concept was simple yet captivating. Teams took on various challenges that tested both wit and luck, from the hilarious Drag Bingo opener to the iconic “Play Your Cards Right” and “The Price is Right.” The crowd’s energy was electric as friends, neighbours, and even those not directly involved in the games shared in the fun. The night celebrated friendly competition, team spirit, and above all, the sense of community that The Anchor is known for.

  

## **Drag Bingo & Day of the Dead Decor Delight Guests**

The night kicked off with Drag Bingo hosted by the marvellous Nikki Manfadge, who brought glamour, wit, and a dash of cheekiness to the stage. With her sharp humour and a knack for drawing laughs, Nikki set the perfect tone for the evening. Sporting a dazzling Day of the Dead costume, she commanded the room with the charm and humour reminiscent of Lily Savage, leaving guests laughing and engaged from start to finish.

  

"Alright, love, get your dabbers ready – and no cheating, I’m watching!” Nikki teased as she began the first round, her comedic timing keeping everyone on their toes. As the bingo numbers were called, shouts of victory rang out from the crowd, along with playful groans from those eagerly waiting for their next number.

  

Adding to the lively atmosphere, The Anchor was decked out in Day of the Dead decorations, creating a visually stunning backdrop for the Halloween season. The decor, with its vibrant colours and intricate details, infused the pub with a festive spirit that enhanced the gameshow experience, making it feel like a night out at a celebratory carnival.

## **Competitive Fun with “Play Your Cards Right” and “The Price is Right”**

In true gameshow style, The Anchor spiced up “Play Your Cards Right” by letting entire teams play as one, adding a layer of camaraderie and competitive spirit that had everyone on their feet. Guests cheered each other on, with a mixture of strategic moves and high-stakes guessing that made for an exhilarating round. The crowd’s reactions – especially during those nail-biting moments when a card flip could change everything – showed just how invested everyone was.

  

Following this, “The Price is Right” put everyone’s knowledge (or lack thereof) to the test. Guests played individually but contributed points to their teams, each guessing the price of everyday items with sometimes wildly inaccurate – and laugh-inducing – estimates. “I think that one’s a fiver!” one player guessed, earning a burst of laughter from those around who knew the item cost far more. The atmosphere was charged with humour, especially as some guests realised their shopping skills might be a bit rusty.

  

Both games brought people together, creating an environment where friends and neighbours enjoyed a night of light-hearted rivalry, laughter, and shared victories.

  

## **Fuel Up Before the Fun - Dining at The Anchor**

Before the games began, guests were invited to enjoy The Anchor’s delicious menu, giving them a chance to fuel up and socialise. From 6 pm to 9 pm, the kitchen was bustling with diners, adding a warm and welcoming feel to the night. Although the meal wasn’t included in the show ticket, many took the opportunity to savour their favourites from the pub’s varied offerings.

  

For those planning to attend future Gameshow House Parties, we encourage arriving early to enjoy a hearty meal and get into the spirit of the evening. Dining at The Anchor is an experience in itself, and a meal shared before the games truly rounds off the night. Not only does it add to the experience, but it also allows guests to settle in and connect with others before the games begin.
