It's been a very exciting first two weeks here at The Anchor for the team and I, we've been busily working to raise standards and the quality of our service.

  

You guys have been coming in in droves for our amazing Sunday Lunch service, selling out both weekends, but we're having challenges delivering the same, great quality during the week.

  

In light of that, we will be stopping our hot food service Monday to Saturday so that we can focus on tasty Sunday lunches. To make sure that we can still get you all fed and watered though, we'll be offering a cold selection of food in the form of freshly made rolls and sandwiches.

  

We'll have more information about our beautiful new menu coming mid-April very soon, please make sure to like our Facebook page to stay updated!
