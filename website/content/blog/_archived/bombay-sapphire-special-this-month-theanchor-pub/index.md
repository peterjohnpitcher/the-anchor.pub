There’s something undeniably magical about a well-made gin and tonic—the crackle of ice, the citrus zest on the rim, the first crisp sip. And when that gin is _Bombay Sapphire_, it becomes a ritual worth savouring. This April at The Anchor, we’re shining the spotlight on this iconic spirit, offering our guests a chance to enjoy it at an irresistible price as part of our **Monthly Manager’s Special**—but only from **1st to 30th April 2025**.

  

Whether you’re winding down after work, catching up with friends, or planning a cosy evening by the fire, Bombay Sapphire has a way of turning simple moments into something special.

  

Crafted in England with a legacy that spans generations, [**Bombay Sapphire**](https://www.bombaysapphire.com) is more than a drink—it’s a story of craftsmanship and creativity. Distilled using a unique vapour-infusion process, it balances ten exotic botanicals, each carefully selected to deliver a distinctive aroma and taste. From earthy angelica to aromatic coriander and citrusy lemon peel, the result is a gin that’s refined, vibrant, and unmistakably smooth.

  

**Why We Chose Bombay Sapphire for Our Manager’s Special**

Here at The Anchor, we take great pride in curating drinks that speak to our guests—and _Bombay Sapphire_ has long been a favourite across our diverse community. Its deep blue bottle is a familiar sight on our back bar, evoking elegance and excellence in equal measure.

But it’s not just about appearances. The flavour profile of Bombay Sapphire makes it perfect for both purists and those who enjoy a bit of flair in their glass. It’s light yet complex, floral yet spicy—ideal for your classic G&T, served just how you like it.

  

We know our guests appreciate quality, and Bombay Sapphire delivers every time.

To make the most of your Bombay Sapphire experience, we offer a carefully selected range of Schweppes mixers and garnishes—from sharp lemon wedges to fragrant rosemary sprigs. Whether you like your gin with Mediterranean tonic and orange peel or elderflower tonic with a sprig of mint, our team is always happy to recommend a pairing that suits your palate.

  

Looking for something to nibble alongside your drink? Bombay Sapphire pairs beautifully with citrus-forward dishes or charcuterie from our seasonal menu. Just ask your server for pairing suggestions—they’ll be delighted to help you find your flavour match.
