## Relish Our Delectable Weekday Menu This Easter Weekend

  

Here at The Anchor, we’re not just serving meals; we’re creating lasting memories. From Good Friday, the 29th of March, through to Easter Monday, we're thrilled to offer our beloved weekday menu from noon until 7 pm. Our assortment includes a plethora of scrumptious options to suit every palate.

  

Picture savouring the crisp, golden Chicken Goujons, or clasping our renowned Beef Stack Burger, bursting with juicy double beef patties and crowned with a crisp onion ring. For those who prefer something a bit lighter, our array of wraps, like the flavourful Fish Finger Wrap brimming with fresh salad, is the perfect pick. Not to overlook our vegetarian guests, our newly named Veggie Stack Burger, a breaded veggie delight topped with fresh greens, promises to tempt even the staunchest carnivores.

  

It's about more than just the food; it's the whole experience. Our homely, family-oriented pub, with its congenial and inviting ambience, is the ideal setting to relax and indulge in these delectable offerings. Whether seeking a haven to unwind after a hectic week or a snug spot for a catch-up with loved ones, The Anchor stands ready to make your Easter weekend remarkable.
