Well, my darlings, if you weren’t at The Anchor’s Gameshow House Party on Wednesday night, then you missed an absolute belter! I’m Nikki Manfadge, your hostess with the mostest, and let me tell you, it was a night that had everything��nostalgia, cheeky laughs, and a crowd that was up for anything. We took your favourite gameshows from the 70s, 80s, and 90s and gave them a wicked twist, all served up with a side of my finest banter. If you weren’t there, what on earth were you doing?

## **The Magic of The Anchor’s Gameshow House Party**

Let’s start at the beginning, shall we? Now, I know we were supposed to kick off at 8 pm, but fashionably late is my middle name, and nothing fabulous ever starts on time, does it? By the time I made my grand entrance, the crowd was raring to go, and the energy was electric. The Gameshow House Party isn’t just a night out, it’s an experience—one that takes you back to the golden days of telly but with a modern twist that you’ll only find at The Anchor.

We had everything—_Bullseye_, _Call My Bluff_, and a room full of lovely people who weren’t shy about getting involved. And let me tell you, it wasn’t just the big burly blokes giving it a go; we had everyone in on the action! From the young to the young-at-heart, everyone was up for a laugh, and that’s what made the night so special.

  

## **Classic Games with a Cheeky Twist**

First up, we had _Bullseye_. Now, forget everything you know about darts because we took it to a whole new level. Picture this—a massive 6ft velcro dartboard and a crowd determined to hit the bullseye. It was hilarious! Watching everyone hurl those velcro balls was a sight to behold, and when they missed, well, I wasn’t about to let them off lightly! I had a few choice words for them, of course, and the whole room was in stitches.

Then we moved on to _Call My Bluff_. Now, this one was a corker! I threw out some of the most ridiculously filthy words and phrases you’ve ever heard, and the crowd had to guess what they meant. The answers ranged from the innocent to the absolutely outrageous, and every single one was met with roars of laughter. No one was shy, everyone got involved, and it was pure, unadulterated fun.

  

### **How the Gameshow House Party Became a Night to Remember**

Now, what made this night truly unforgettable wasn’t just the games—it was the people. The crowd was fabulous, the energy was through the roof, and there was a real sense of community. Strangers became friends as they cheered each other on, debated the meanings of some very dodgy words, and competed for the evening’s big prize.

Speaking of prizes, one lucky devil walked away with a _brand new car and caravan_! Alright, it was only 2 inches tall, but that’s beside the point. The big reveal had everyone in fits of laughter, and it perfectly summed up the spirit of the night—it’s not the size of the prize that matters, it’s the fun you have along the way.

  

## **Why You Shouldn’t Miss the Next Gameshow House Party**
