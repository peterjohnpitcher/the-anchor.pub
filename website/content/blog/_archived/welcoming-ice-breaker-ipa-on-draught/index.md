It's been a long time since we last saw an pale ale on draught here at The Anchor, and we couldn't be more excited to introduce a new, citrus based pale ale back ready for the winter season!

Ice Breaker is triple hopped with Citra and Simcoe to deliver citrus and tropical fruit aromas and tastes, complimented with fresh pine resin and a crisp bitterness. Pale and amber malts give balanced sweetness and the addition of carapils malt and torrefied wheat contributes body and mouthfeel.
