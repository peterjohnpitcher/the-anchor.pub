## We are very pleased to be offering the Eat Out to Help Out scheme throughout August 2020!

  

We're hoping to have our Quiz nights back up on Wednesday nights very soon, this could be a great opportunity to get out, have some fun and a massive discount on dinner, all at the same time.

  

### What is Eat Out to Help Out?

It is a government backed scheme to help revitalize the hospitality sector following lock down. The scheme lets our customers enjoy our dine-in meals with 50% discount (up to Â£10) off the meal per person.

  

### What do I need to do to get the discount?

We will be offering the discount throughout August for anyone that dines with us. You don't need any vouchers or proof, it can be used as many times as you like on Mondays, Tuesdays and Wednesdays.

  

### Who is eligible to get the discount?

Anyone that dines in with us is eligible, including children.

  

### Is it available on all of the menu?

Yes, any food items that you order from our food menu (available at the bar or by clicking the below link) are eligible for the discount. The discount only applies to items on our printed menu as well as non-alcoholic drinks when consumed with a meal.

  

## See our Menu here: [The Anchor - Food Menu](https://1c749e73-f42b-4e4c-bd2f-e3a9441f80a4.usrfiles.com/ugd/1c749e_992be47248784137a62748872bc677a0.pdf)

  

We are working to confirm additional details around the offer and how we can help our customers make the most of the opportunity, we'll provide more details when they're available.

  

  

  

Thank you!
