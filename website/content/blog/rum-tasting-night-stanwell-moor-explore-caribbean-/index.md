## **Experience a Caribbean Adventure in the Heart of Stanwell Moor**

Step into the warmth and rhythm of the Caribbean without leaving Surrey. Our **Rum Tasting Night in Stanwell Moor** is more than just a drinks event—it’s a celebration of flavour, community, and culture, all under the cosy roof of The Anchor. Whether you’re a seasoned spirit lover or a curious first-timer, this night promises to awaken your senses and spark new connections.

  

## **What to Expect at Our Rum Tasting Night in Stanwell Moor**

### **A Warm Welcome and Vibrant Atmosphere**

The evening kicks off at 7 PM with a tropical welcome drink in our beautifully decorated Private Dining Room. Caribbean-themed décor sets the tone for a night of relaxation and fun, creating a truly immersive experience. Expect a room filled with vibrant colours, island beats, and the unmistakable buzz of community spirit.

  

### **Guided Tasting Journey with Expert Insights**

Led by Peter Pitcher, a passionate connoisseur, the guided tasting introduces six carefully chosen rums—each offering a unique insight into the heritage and craft of Caribbean distilling. Learn about their origins, tasting notes, and suggested pairings while enjoying neat pours and shared stories.

  

### **Flavours of the Caribbean: A Themed Supper**

Midway through the evening, enjoy a hearty Caribbean-inspired meal. Our menu features jerk chicken, rice and peas, and fried plantain—soul food that perfectly complements the evening’s theme. A vegetarian alternative ensures everyone is included, reflecting The Anchor’s commitment to diversity and inclusivity.

  

## **The Joy of Shared Moments and Island Culture**

### **Test Your Knowledge with a Caribbean Quiz**

The night continues with a lively themed quiz that blends fun facts about rum with cultural gems from the Caribbean—music, food, geography, and more. It’s a chance to laugh, learn, and maybe even win a prize as you connect with fellow attendees over shared smiles and spirited answers.

  

### **Shake Things Up in Our Cocktail-Making Session**

To close the night, you’ll step behind the bar (metaphorically!) and get hands-on in crafting your own Caribbean cocktail. From mojitos to daiquiris, it’s a playful, creative way to end the evening on a high. You’ll leave with new skills—and perhaps a new favourite drink.
