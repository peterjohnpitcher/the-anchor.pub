## Our Stance on Amazon's Premier League Coverage

While we are committed to bringing you as much Premier League action as possible, we must voice our objection to Amazon's exclusive coverage in December. It‚Äôs disappointing to see matches taken away from pubs, especially during a crucial month for both the league and local businesses like ours. We believe football should be accessible to all, and we stand against such moves that gauge pubs striving to deliver the best sports experience to their patrons.
