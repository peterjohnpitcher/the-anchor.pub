### **Christmas Quiz Night with Pete (11th December)**

We kicked off the Christmas cheer in style with our Christmas Special Pub Quiz, hosted by Pete. The night was full of festive fun, good-natured competition, and plenty of laughs. Teams gathered to test their knowledge on everything from classic Christmas movies to general trivia.

  

One of the highlights of the night had to be Penny’s unforgettable charades performance while trying to act out a fireplace. Her creative (and slightly baffling) interpretation had everyone in stitches. The Christmas jumper bonus round was another hit, with some of the most outrageous and creative designs we’ve ever seen earning teams extra points.

  

Nights like this remind us how much fun our community can have when we all come together to share a laugh.

  

### **Winter Warmers Tasting Night (13th December)**

Our Winter Warmers Tasting Night was truly special, and we were thrilled to hear so many of you say it was our best tasting night yet. We worked hard to create a cosy, intimate setting where you could enjoy some of the finest seasonal drinks paired with delicious canapés.

  

We started the night with hot mulled cider, filling the room with its rich, spiced aroma. The tasting journey featured festive favourites like sloe gin, dark rum, and a creamy Baileys-based cocktail, each paired with canapés designed to complement the flavours. Smoked salmon blinis, brie and cranberry tartlets, and other bite-sized treats added an extra touch of indulgence.

  

The festive quiz we added to the evening was a fun way to get everyone involved, and your glowing reviews meant the world to us. Nights like these are why we love hosting tasting events, and we can’t wait to do it all again soon.

  

### **Gameshow House Party: Sleigh That Tune Edition (18th December)**

We closed out our festive events with a bang at the Gameshow House Party: Sleigh That Tune Edition. Hosted by the fabulous Nikki Manfadge, this night was filled with glamour, sass, and endless laughter.

  

From Speedy Bingo to the hilarious Sleigh That Tune game, the evening was packed with excitement. Watching everyone try to guess festive tunes from some hilariously vague clues was a real highlight. Nikki’s cheeky humour and fabulous outfits kept the energy high, and her Drag Bingo segment was a huge hit.

  

Classic gameshow favourites like Play Your Cards Right and The Price Is Right added even more fun, and the festive prizes made the night extra special. Thank you to everyone who joined us for what turned out to be one of the most memorable nights of the year.

  

## **Record-Breaking Festive Food Near Heathrow Airport**

December wasn't just about events—it was also our busiest month for food service at The Anchor, your **traditional pub near Heathrow**. Our kitchen team worked tirelessly to serve **pub classics** and festive specials to airport staff celebrating after shifts, travelers enjoying British hospitality, and locals from **Stanwell Moor** and **Staines**.

  

Our seasonal drinks menu was just as popular, with mulled wine and spiced cider flying off the bar. We’re so proud of our kitchen and bar teams for their incredible efforts, making sure that every guest left with a full belly and a smile. Seeing so many of you enjoy what we had to offer made all the hard work worthwhile.

  

## **Looking Ahead to 2025**

As we say goodbye to an amazing December, we’re already looking ahead to what promises to be an exciting year. We’re hard at work planning a calendar full of new promotions, events, and deals for 2025. While we can’t reveal everything just yet, we’re confident that next year will be our biggest and best yet.

  

Stay tuned for updates at the end of January, and get ready for more unforgettable experiences at The Anchor. We can’t wait to share what’s coming next and to continue making memories with all of you.

  

December was a month to remember for us at The Anchor. From the laughter of our Christmas quiz night to the glamour of our Gameshow House Party and the warmth of our Winter Warmers Tasting Night, we were reminded of the joy that comes from bringing people together.

  

Thank you for making The Anchor your **Christmas pub of choice near Heathrow Airport**. Whether you're airport staff, a traveler passing through, or a local from **Stanwell Moor**, we're grateful for your support and can't wait to welcome you back.
