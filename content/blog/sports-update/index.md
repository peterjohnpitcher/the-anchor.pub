## Sports Viewing Update at The Anchor Near Heathrow Airport

At The Anchor in **Stanwell Moor**, just **7 minutes from Heathrow Terminal 5**, we've been the go-to **sports bar near the airport** for years. Our family-friendly pub has brought together **Heathrow workers**, locals from **Staines**, and sports fans to enjoy major free-to-air tournaments and highlight shows together.

  

However, rising costs and dwindling interest have forced us to make a difficult decision.

As of **January 24th, 2025**, we will no longer show Sky Sports and TNT Sports. While we remain in active negotiations with these providers and are hopeful for a positive outcome, this service will end unless a feasible solution is found. 

### **Good News: Major Sports Still Available Near Heathrow**

**We will continue showing sports on terrestrial channels** at our **pub near Terminal 5**, including:
- **Six Nations Rugby** - Every match live
- **FIFA World Cup** - All England games
- **FA Cup** - Key fixtures and finals
- **Wimbledon** - Centre Court action
- **UEFA Euros** - Complete coverage
- **Commonwealth Games** - British athletes

  

## **Why This Sports Bar Update Affects Our Heathrow Location**

The cost of broadcasting sports in hospitality venues has become untenable. Providers like Sky Sports and TNT Sports charge businesses rates that far exceed those for residential customers. These costs have risen significantly this year, making it incredibly challenging for independent pubs like ours to justify keeping sports on offer without impacting other vital services.

  

As a community pub, we work hard to maintain the quality of our food, drinks, and events without passing excessive costs onto our customers. Continuing to host sports under the current circumstances would jeopardise the very services that make The Anchor a beloved hub for Stanwell Moor. This **Anchor sports update**¬†reflects our commitment to safeguarding the experiences our customers value most.

  

## **Changing Customer Demand for Sport**

In addition to rising costs, customer interest in sport has dwindled dramatically in the last two years. While sport was a major draw during the pre-COVID era, footfall for sports events has dropped by over 75% since lockdowns ended. This means that fewer of our patrons are enjoying this aspect of what we offer, while the costs have continued to rise disproportionately. This trend is one of the key reasons behind our **Anchor sports update**¬†decision.

  

## **Our Commitment to Community and Core Services**

By stepping away from subscription-based sports broadcasting, we can ensure that our focus remains where it should be‚Äîon providing an exceptional experience for the majority of our community. This includes:

*   **Continued investment**¬†in high-quality food, drinks, and events.
    
*   Building an inclusive and welcoming space where families, friends, and neighbours can gather.
    
*   Prioritising the core services that reflect the values and needs of Stanwell Moor.
    

This **Anchor sports update**¬†allows us to keep delivering the standards and services that make The Anchor such an important part of the community.

We‚Äôre also thrilled to share that our **2025 plan**, featuring a host of exciting new offerings and experiences, will be unveiled later this month.

  

### **What Happens Next?**

We understand that this news may come as a disappointment to some, and we share in that frustration. Sport has always been a part of The Anchor, and this decision was not made lightly. We also want to acknowledge the role that providers like Sky Sports and TNT Sports have played in this situation, with their steep pricing structures placing undue pressure on independent pubs like ours.

  

We remain in active negotiations with these providers and are hopeful for a positive outcome. However, at this time, subscription-based sports broadcasting at The Anchor will end on **January 24th, 2025**. If circumstances change, we will provide updates as soon as possible.
