There’s a warmth you can’t quite bottle – the hum of familiar voices, the aroma of a bubbling pie, and the sight of bunting fluttering above the bar. At The Anchor, that warmth has a name: _community_. And this May, we're inviting everyone to celebrate that spirit with us as we mark **VE Day at The Anchor** – a week dedicated to remembering, reconnecting, and raising a glass to the good old days.

  

From 6–11 May 2025, our pub becomes a time machine of sorts – a place where classic meals meet classic music, and strangers sing together like old friends. With 25% off British favourites and two standout events mid-week, this is more than a promotion. It’s a celebration of what binds us.

  

## Why VE Day at The Anchor Is More Than Just a Pub Event

VE Day – or **Victory in Europe Day** – commemorates 8 May 1945, the moment when peace returned to Europe at the end of the Second World War. It was a day of church bells, street parties, and hopeful toasts. Families gathered around wireless radios. Communities danced in the streets. And in every town and village, local pubs threw open their doors to welcome the joyful chaos.

  

That spirit lives on at **The Anchor**, a community-led pub in the heart of Stanwell Moor. We’re not just a place to eat and drink – we’re a living room for the village, a hub for stories, laughter, and reflection. This VE Day, we’re proud to carry on the tradition of marking this important moment in history – not with solemn silence, but with music, memories, and togetherness.
