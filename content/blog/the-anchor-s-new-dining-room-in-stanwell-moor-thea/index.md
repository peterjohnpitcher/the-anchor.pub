## A New Chapter at The Anchor

  

Nestled in the heart of Stanwell Moor Village, The Anchor, a charming and beloved local pub, is embarking on a thrilling journey of transformation. Renowned for its cosy atmosphere and community spirit, we are now taking a significant leap forward. The much-loved conservatory, a fixture of The Anchor since 1995, is being replaced by a splendid new Dining Room. This change is not just a refurbishment; it's a renewal of our commitment to our patrons and the community.

  

## Design and Architectural Features

  

### Bright and Welcoming New Space

  

The new extension, fondly to be known as the Dining Room, is poised to become a beacon of light and comfort. Envision windows spanning the sides, inviting the sunshine in and creating a space bathed in natural light. At the rear, French doors will open up to the fresh air, seamlessly blending the indoors with the beauty of our garden. The roof, though retaining its charming pitched exterior, will be flat inside – a nod to modernity with a purpose. This design is more than aesthetic; it's about enveloping our guests in warmth during the winter and providing a cool haven in the summer.

  

## Interior Renovation and Decor

  

## A Fresh Palette for the Pub

  

As we usher in this new era, The Anchor is also undergoing a revamp in its interior décor. The Dining Room will be the first to receive a fresh coat of colours, setting the tone for an exciting and cohesive redesign of the entire pub. This rejuvenation will reflect our ethos – a place where tradition meets contemporary comfort, a place that feels like home for everyone.

  

## Sustainability and Efficiency

  

### Environmentally Conscious Renovation

  

In line with our commitment to the environment and the future, the new Dining Room isn't just about aesthetic appeal. We are integrating features to improve energy efficiency, thereby reducing our environmental impact. Once complete, we anticipate a better EPC rating, reflecting our efforts in providing a warm and welcoming space, responsibly. This initiative is a testament to our dedication to not just serving the community but also caring for our environment.

  

## Enhancing the Customer Experience

  

### A Space for Every Occasion

  

The new Dining Room will not merely be a space; it will be an experience. Envisioned as a more formal dining area, it will cater to our weekly patrons and our famous Sunday lunch service with a touch of elegance. It's also perfect for private dinner bookings, making it ideal for large group gatherings and parties. Alongside this physical transformation, we are also elevating our culinary offerings. The year 2024 will see The Anchor introducing a menu brimming with home-cooked delights, marrying tradition with innovation.

  

## Historical Significance

  

### Carrying Forward a Legacy

  

The conservatory holds a special place in the history of The Anchor and the hearts of our patrons. Erected for George and Alex Best's wedding reception in 1995, it has been a venue for countless family celebrations and community events. As we transition to the Dining Room, we carry forward this legacy of togetherness and joy. It's not just a renovation; it's a continuation of a story woven into the fabric of our village.

  

## A Message to Our Customers

  

### Embracing Change Together

  

We acknowledge that the transformation journey might bring a bit of hustle and bustle. As we embark on this exciting project, starting the week of April 22nd, there may be a little noise and temporary changes, like the partial closure of our back garden. But we assure you, it's a small step towards a significant enhancement in your Anchor experience. We appreciate your understanding and support during this period and are excited to unveil the new Dining Room, ready to welcome you for the Euro 2024 games starting June 14th.
