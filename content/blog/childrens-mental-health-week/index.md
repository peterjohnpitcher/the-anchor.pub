**Children’s Mental Health Week** (3rd – 9th February 2025) is an opportunity to **raise awareness, encourage open conversations, and promote positive mental well-being for young minds**.

  

At **The Anchor**, we understand how important it is for families to spend quality time together. That’s why, for one week only, **we’re offering free meals for children** when dining with an adult who orders from our **mains, burgers, or 12” pizza menus**.

  

📅 **Offer valid from Tuesday 4th to Sunday 9th February 2025**

🍽️ **Available for dine-in and takeaway**

  

This is more than just a meal—it’s a chance to **pause, connect, and check in on the children in our lives**.

  

## **What is Children’s Mental Health Week?**

**Children’s Mental Health Week** is an annual campaign founded by **Place2Be**, a UK charity focused on improving children’s mental health. The initiative aims to:

*   Raise awareness of the importance of **mental well-being in childhood**.
    
*   Encourage **families, schools, and communities** to support young minds.
    
*   Provide **practical tools** for helping children manage their emotions.
    

  

With **one in six children aged 5–16 facing mental health challenges**, this week serves as an important reminder that **mental health is just as crucial as physical health**.

  

👉 Learn more at [**Place2Be**](https://www.place2be.org.uk/).

  

## **Recognising the Signs of Poor Mental Health in Children**

Children don’t always have the words to express how they’re feeling. Instead, they may **show signs through their emotions, behaviour, or physical health**.

  

### **Emotional Signs**

*   Persistent **sadness, worry, or mood swings**.
    
*   Low **self-esteem** or frequent self-criticism.
    
*   Unusual **irritability or frustration**.
    

  

### **Behavioural Changes**

*   Avoiding **school, social situations, or family time**.
    
*   Sudden outbursts of **anger or emotional withdrawal**.
    
*   Loss of interest in **hobbies or activities they once enjoyed**.
    

  

### **Physical Symptoms**

*   **Frequent headaches or stomach aches** with no clear cause.
    
*   **Changes in appetite** – eating much more or much less than usual.
    
*   **Difficulty sleeping** or having frequent nightmares.
    

  

If your child is showing any of these signs, offering a **safe space to talk** and seeking **support when necessary** can make a significant difference.

## **Practical Ways to Support a Child’s Mental Health**

Supporting a child’s mental health doesn’t have to be complicated—small, everyday actions can **make a big difference**.

  

### **Encourage Open Conversations**

*   **Ask open-ended questions** like _“What was the best part of your day?”_ rather than _“Did you have a good day?”_.
    
*   **Listen without judgement** and allow them to express their feelings.
    
*   **Validate their emotions** and reassure them that it’s okay to feel upset or anxious.
    

  

### **Build a Stable Routine**

*   Having **consistent mealtimes and bedtimes** creates **security and stability**.
    
*   Encourage **a balance of study, play, and relaxation** to prevent stress.
    
*   Maintain **a calm home environment** where they feel safe and supported.
    

  

### **Limit Screen Time & Encourage Outdoor Activities**

*   Social media can **negatively impact self-esteem**, so setting boundaries can help.
    
*   Encourage outdoor activities such as **walking, cycling, or playing in the park**.
    
*   Simple activities like **gardening, painting, or reading** can promote relaxation.
    

  

### **Teach Simple Relaxation Techniques**

*   **Deep breathing exercises** (inhale for four seconds, hold for four, exhale for four).
    
*   **Mindfulness and meditation apps** such as _Headspace for Kids_.
    
*   **Journaling or creative outlets** to help express thoughts and emotions.
