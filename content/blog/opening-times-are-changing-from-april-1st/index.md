As we continue our journey in to developing The Anchor to being a wonderful place to be again, we will be updating our opening times from April 1st to best suit the needs of the majority of our customers.

At the minute, we're open until 23:00 most nights in the week but it's causing us to spread the team and our funds very thin, rather than focusing the team on the times when you really need us there.

New opening times will constantly be up for review and may vary for parties, events and functions.

We will clearly display our opening times next to the front door from March 28th, if you have any questions, please make sure to let me, or the team know.

  

Thanks,

  

Billy
