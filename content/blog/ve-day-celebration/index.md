With 25% off classic British dishes, special quiz nights, and heartwarming sing-along karaoke, we create the perfect atmosphere for families, Heathrow workers, and local residents to commemorate this historic occasion.

## Why VE Day at The Anchor Is More Than Just a Pub Event

VE Day – or **Victory in Europe Day** – commemorates 8 May 1945, the moment when peace returned to Europe at the end of the Second World War. It was a day of church bells, street parties, and hopeful toasts. Families gathered around wireless radios. Communities danced in the streets. And in every town and village, local pubs threw open their doors to welcome the joyful chaos.

That spirit lives on at **The Anchor**, your traditional British pub just minutes from Heathrow Terminal 5. Located in the heart of Stanwell Moor, we're the perfect venue for Heathrow workers, Staines residents, and visitors to experience authentic British heritage. This VE Day, we're proud to carry on the tradition of marking this important moment in history – creating a welcoming space where locals and airport staff come together to celebrate.
