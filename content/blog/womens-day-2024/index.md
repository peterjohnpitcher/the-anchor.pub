## International Women's Day Celebration Near Heathrow Airport

As we approach International Women's Day, celebrated globally on 8th March, it's a time to reflect on the strides we've made towards gender equality and the journey ahead. At The Anchor in **Stanwell Moor**, just **7 minutes from Heathrow Terminal 5**, we're gearing up to mark this momentous day with a series of celebrations that epitomise our commitment to inclusivity and community spirit. Perfect for **Heathrow workers**, **Staines residents**, and anyone near the **airport** wanting to celebrate women's achievements in a welcoming, female-led pub environment.

  

#### **Why We Celebrate International Women's Day**

International Women's Day, with a history spanning over a century, began as a movement advocating for women's rights, particularly suffrage and fair working conditions. Today, it has evolved into a global celebration of women's social, economic, cultural, and political achievements. It's a day when we not only celebrate progress but also actively promote continued efforts towards achieving gender parity.

  

#### **International Women's Day 2024 Theme: #InspireInclusion**

The theme for International Women's Day 2024 is #InspireInclusion, a clarion call to inspire others to understand and value the importance of women's inclusion in every aspect of life. At The Anchor, this theme resonates with our ethos. We're more than just a pub; we're a melting pot of cultures and generations, where everyone from the young mother to the seasoned traveller finds a warm welcome.

  

#### **Honouring Women at The Anchor**

In the heart of our establishment lies a team predominantly composed of incredible women. They are the backbone of The Anchor, bringing dedication, warmth, and exceptional service to our community every day. With many **female staff members** including our managers and kitchen team, we're proud to be a female-led business near **Heathrow Airport**. We're not just acknowledging our staff; we extend our gratitude to the women of our community - the mothers, grandmothers, daughters, friends, and every woman who walks through our doors.

  

#### **Celebrations at The Anchor Near Terminal 5**

This International Women's Day, we're hosting a range of activities that embrace the #InspireInclusion theme:

- **Special menu items** featuring dishes inspired by iconic women from various cultures
- **Purple-themed decorations** throughout the pub
- **Storytelling sessions** sharing tales of inspirational local women
- **Live music** featuring female artists from the area
- **Complimentary prosecco** for the first 50 women through the door
- **Charity collection** for local women's organizations

  

#### **The Significance of Colours and Slogan for Women's Day 2024**

Purple, the official colour of International Women's Day, symbolises justice and dignity - values we hold dear at The Anchor. We encourage our guests to wear a hint of purple to show solidarity with the cause of women's equality. The slogan for 2024, "Inspire Inclusion," is a reminder that inclusion is not just a woman's issue, it's a societal one.

  

#### **The Global and Local Impact of Women's Day**

International Women's Day isn't just a global phenomenon; its impact resonates at the local level, in communities just like ours. The Anchor prides itself on being a hub where these global conversations find a local voice. We celebrate:

- **Heathrow's female workforce** - pilots, engineers, and ground staff
- **Local businesswomen** from Stanwell Moor and Staines
