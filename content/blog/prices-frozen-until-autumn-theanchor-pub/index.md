## Price Freeze Near Heathrow Airport - No Increases Until Autumn 2025

When everything around us keeps going up—from your weekly shop to a pint at the pub—we're doing something different at The Anchor in **Stanwell Moor**, just **7 minutes from Heathrow Terminal 5**. We've made the decision to keep our **prices frozen until autumn** 2025. That means no draught price increases and a summer full of solid value, brilliant drinks, and welcoming community vibes. Perfect for **Heathrow workers** escaping airport prices, **Staines residents** enjoying their local, and anyone near the **airport** who values proper pub prices.

  

This isn't a gimmick or a flash sale. It's a promise. Because at The Anchor, we believe in looking after our own.

  

## Why We're Keeping Prices Frozen Until Autumn

### Community First, Always

We know the pressure people are under right now. That's why we've chosen to **hold our draught prices at their April 2024 rate**—with no increases planned until autumn 2025.

It's not about being the cheapest. It's about being a pub you can count on.

  

### Built on Real Partnership

Thanks to our strong relationship with [Greene King](https://www.greeneking.co.uk/), we're able to offer **great products at fair prices**.
