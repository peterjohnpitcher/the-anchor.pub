On 13th June, The Anchor hosted a spectacular rum tasting night that achieved perfect 5-star reviews. Fifteen fortunate guests discovered the incredible diversity of premium rum right here in Stanwell Moor. With guest ratings of 5.6 out of 5 (yes, someone actually gave us 6/5!), this special event proved why unique experiences like this become the most talked-about nights at our pub.

  

## **Why This Special Event Sold Out Within Days**

When we announced this special rum tasting night, tickets sold out rapidly. The evening brought together rum enthusiasts and curious newcomers for an experience that transcended typical pub events.

  

"Can't believe I have been missing out!" exclaimed one first-timer. This perfectly captures why special events like this create such buzz - they unlock flavour worlds that even seasoned drinkers never knew existed.

  

### **The Secret Formula Behind 5-Star Reviews**

Our rum tasting night's success wasn't accidental. The evening featured:

*   Six to seven premium spirit tastings
    
*   Restaurant-quality food pairings
    
*   Expert guidance without pretension
    
*   Surprise elements that create lasting memories
    
*   Limited to 25 guests for intimate atmosphere
    

  

According to [industry experts](https://www.diffordsguide.com/encyclopedia/198/bws/rum-the-worlds-most-diverse-spirit), rum's complexity and variety make it ideal for structured tastings, and our guests discovered this firsthand.

  

## **The Rum Tasting Night That Featured Premium Brands**

This wasn't just another spirits event. From the moment guests arrived to find tropical-themed table settings and premium glassware, they knew something extraordinary awaited. Our carefully curated selection showcased rum's incredible diversity through partnerships with world-class distilleries - from coconut-infused crowd-pleasers to controversial banana expressions that sparked passionate debates.

  

### **Premium Rums That Stole Hearts**

The star of our rum tasting night was undoubtedly [Bacardi](https://www.bacardi.com/) Coconut, which earned a perfect 6/5 rating. "Smells like coconut, easy smooth taste like a pi√±a colada but better," swooned one guest. This enthusiasm reflects the [growing trend](https://www.thespiritsbusiness.com/2024/01/flavoured-rum-market-growth/) of premium flavoured rums capturing hearts worldwide.

  

Our carefully curated selection featured premium brands including:

*   [Captain Morgan](https://www.captainmorgan.com/) Tiki and Sliced Apple from Diageo
    
*   [RedLeg](https://www.redlegrum.com/) range including their show-stopping Caramelised Pineapple
    
*   [Bumbu](https://www.bumbu.com/) Original from Pernod Ricard
    
*   [Trash & Treasure](https://warnerdistillery.com/) Banana Rum from Warner's
    

  

Other standouts included:

*   RedLeg Gingered that revealed "sweet vanilla with fire behind it"
    
*   Captain Morgan Tiki perfect with tropical mixers
    
*   The divisive banana rum that proved "there's a rum soulmate for everyone"
    

  

## **Caribbean Feast Elevates the Experience**

Forget typical pub fare - our rum tasting night featured authentic Caribbean cuisine that transported guests straight to the islands. Our kitchen team, managing a packed pub, somehow delivered restaurant-quality jerk chicken, perfectly seasoned rice and peas, and sides that complemented each rum's profile.

  

"Really enjoyed the food and pairings. Educational but fun!" barely captures the enthusiasm. Food and rum pairings are [gaining recognition](https://www.bbcgoodfood.com/howto/guide/introduction-rum) as essential to appreciating spirits properly, and our pairings proved this brilliantly.

  

### **Why Food Pairings Matter**

Professional tastings understand that palate cleansing and complementary flavours are crucial. Our spicy jerk seasoning made sweeter rums sing, whilst coconut notes in certain expressions harmonised perfectly with the tropical feast.

  

Premium mixers from [Fever-Tree](https://www.fever-tree.com/) and [Schweppes](https://www.schweppes.com/) elevated each rum, with guests discovering perfect combinations - from ginger ale transforming Bumbu to tropical sodas enhancing the fruity expressions. This attention to detail separates amateur events from our professional approach.

  

## **Next Special Event: November**

The [premium spirits market](https://drinksint.com/news/fullstory.php/aid/10234/) continues to evolve with exciting innovations, and we're always exploring new ways to bring exceptional experiences to Stanwell Moor.
