On 13th June, The Anchor hosted its fifth quarterly tasting event - a spectacular rum tasting night that maintained our perfect 5-star record. Fifteen fortunate guests discovered the incredible diversity of premium rum right here in Stanwell Moor. With guest ratings of 5.6 out of 5 (yes, someone actually gave us 6/5!), this latest triumph proves why our tasting events have become the most coveted tickets in the area.

  

## **Why Our Tasting Events Sell Out Within Days**

Since launching with gin in October 2023, followed by tequila, winter warmers, and spring spirits, we've created something special. Our rum tasting night continued this legacy, bringing together devoted regulars and eager newcomers for an evening that transcended typical pub events.

  

"Can't believe I have been missing out!" exclaimed one first-timer, echoing sentiments we hear at every event. This perfectly captures why our quarterly gatherings have achieved cult status - they unlock flavour worlds that even seasoned drinkers never knew existed.

  

### **The Secret Formula Behind 5-Star Reviews**

Our success isn't accidental. Each event features:

*   Six to seven premium spirit tastings
    
*   Restaurant-quality food pairings
    
*   Expert guidance without pretension
    
*   Surprise elements that create lasting memories
    
*   Limited to 25 guests for intimate atmosphere
    

  

According to [industry experts](https://www.diffordsguide.com/encyclopedia/198/bws/rum-the-worlds-most-diverse-spirit), rum's complexity and variety make it ideal for structured tastings, and our guests discovered this firsthand.

  

## **The Rum Tasting Night That Featured Premium Brands**

This wasn't just another spirits event. From the moment guests arrived to find tropical-themed table settings and premium glassware, they knew something extraordinary awaited. Our carefully curated selection showcased rum's incredible diversity through partnerships with world-class distilleries - from coconut-infused crowd-pleasers to controversial banana expressions that sparked passionate debates.

  

### **Premium Rums That Stole Hearts**

The star of our rum tasting night was undoubtedly [Bacardi](https://www.bacardi.com/) Coconut, which earned a perfect 6/5 rating. "Smells like coconut, easy smooth taste like a pi√±a colada but better," swooned one guest. This enthusiasm reflects the [growing trend](https://www.thespiritsbusiness.com/2024/01/flavoured-rum-market-growth/) of premium flavoured rums capturing hearts worldwide.

  

Our carefully curated selection featured premium brands including:

*   [Captain Morgan](https://www.captainmorgan.com/) Tiki and Sliced Apple from Diageo
    
*   [RedLeg](https://www.redlegrum.com/) range including their show-stopping Caramelised Pineapple
    
*   [Bumbu](https://www.bumbu.com/) Original from Pernod Ricard
    
*   [Trash & Treasure](https://warnerdistillery.com/) Banana Rum from Warner's
    

  

Other standouts included:

*   RedLeg Gingered that revealed "sweet vanilla with fire behind it"
    
*   Captain Morgan Tiki perfect with tropical mixers
    
*   The divisive banana rum that proved "there's a rum soulmate for everyone"
    

  

## **Caribbean Feast Elevates the Experience**

Forget typical pub fare - our rum tasting night featured authentic Caribbean cuisine that transported guests straight to the islands. Our kitchen team, managing a packed pub, somehow delivered restaurant-quality jerk chicken, perfectly seasoned rice and peas, and sides that complemented each rum's profile.

  

"Really enjoyed the food and pairings. Educational but fun!" barely captures the enthusiasm. Food and rum pairings are [gaining recognition](https://www.bbcgoodfood.com/howto/guide/introduction-rum) as essential to appreciating spirits properly, and our pairings proved this brilliantly.

  

### **Why Food Pairings Matter**

Professional tastings understand that palate cleansing and complementary flavours are crucial. Our spicy jerk seasoning made sweeter rums sing, whilst coconut notes in certain expressions harmonised perfectly with the tropical feast.

  

Premium mixers from [Fever-Tree](https://www.fever-tree.com/) and [Schweppes](https://www.schweppes.com/) elevated each rum, with guests discovering perfect combinations - from ginger ale transforming Bumbu to tropical sodas enhancing the fruity expressions. This attention to detail separates amateur events from our professional approach.

## **Building Britain's Best Tasting Community**

What transforms good events into legendary ones? Community. Watching strangers become friends over shared discoveries, seeing regulars mentor newcomers, hearing animated debates about flavour profiles - this is what makes our quarterly gatherings special.

"Amazing night, amazing host, amazing drink!" summarised one guest. Another insisted: "Would attend again!!!" whilst a convert promised "100% coming to the next one." This isn't just feedback - it's evidence of a movement.

  

### **The Tasting Club Effect**

Since October 2023, we've built a genuine tasting community. Members travel from across the region, plan holidays around events, and introduce friends to what one regular calls "the highlight of my social calendar." This mirrors the [global trend](https://www.forbes.com/sites/joemicallef/2023/09/15/the-rise-of-spirits-education/) of consumers seeking educational drinking experiences.

  

### **Special Thanks to Our Premium Partners**
