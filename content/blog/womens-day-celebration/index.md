## What is International Women's Day?

March 8th is a special day for women around the world. It's a day when we celebrate the achievements of women and the progress we've made towards gender equality. International Women's Day (IWD) is a global observance that has been recognised for over 100 years, and it continues to grow in significance and importance.

  

## Why Celebrate International Women's Day?

International Women's Day is a time to reflect on the achievements of women and to raise awareness about the ongoing struggles for gender equality. Women have made significant contributions to society in all fields of life, from science and technology to arts and politics. They have fought for their rights and paved the way for future generations to live in a more equal world. However, there is still a long way to go before gender equality is achieved.

This year‚Äôs theme for International Women's Day is ‚ÄúChoose to Challenge‚Äù. It calls for everyone to challenge gender bias and inequality in all its forms. By challenging the status quo, we can help create a more inclusive world where women and girls have equal opportunities and can reach their full potential.
