## Greene King IPA

![the boys are back in town image](/content/blog/the-boys-are-back-in-town/image-2.jpeg)

Greene Kings IPA is their flagship beer, brewed in their hometown, Bury St.Edmunds.

As a pale ale, it has a clean, fresh taste based in golden hops with a moderately herbal character.

  

With a caramel finish, it's delicious and light enough to enjoy during the day. Best paired with spicy foods, maybe something to enjoy at one of our curry nights?

  

At ¬£4.50 for a 500ml bottle, it's just as 'pale' on your pocket as it will be on your palate!

###   

## Abbot Ale

An old favourite here at The Anchor, Abbot Ale is a full, distinctive beer that screams of traditional, UK beer brewing.

  

It's deep, rich mahogany colouring, paired with its fruity smell and malty taste will flood your taste buds with complex flavours.

  

Best enjoyed with a Sunday Roast or (if you can believe it), cheese, it'll bring out the best notes in the beer.

  

Experience the depth of traditional British brewing with every sip of Abbot Ale at our **real ale pub near Heathrow**.
