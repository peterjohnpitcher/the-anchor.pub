## Premium Gin Offers Near Heathrow Airport

Welcome to The Anchor in **Stanwell Moor**, just **7 minutes from Heathrow Terminal 5**, where we're celebrating The Botanist gin with special July prices! At just ¬£2.78 a single or ¬£5.55 a double, it's perfect for **Heathrow workers** after shifts, **Staines residents** enjoying premium spirits, or travelers seeking quality gin near the **airport** without inflated prices.

  

## **What Makes The Botanist Gin So Special?**

Here's the fun bit ‚Äì The Botanist contains a whopping 31 botanicals! That includes 22 hand-foraged beauties from the Scottish island of Islay. We're talking wild juniper, elderflower, and even some thistle (it's Scottish after all!). The folks at Bruichladdich Distillery actually send people out to pick these by hand. How's that for dedication to your G&T?

  

## **The Perfect Summer G&T Awaits**

All month long, we're serving The Botanist with premium tonic water and a fresh wedge of lime ‚Äì simple, classic, and absolutely refreshing. It's the kind of drink that makes you wonder why you'd ever complicate things. The botanical complexity of the gin does all the talking, creating layers of flavour that unfold with every sip.

  

Whether you're cooling down after work, catching up with friends, or just enjoying a quiet moment in our beer garden, The Botanist makes every occasion feel a bit more special. And at our July prices, you might just find yourself staying for another!

  

## **Why The Anchor is Your Botanist Destination**

We've been serving the good people of Stanwell Moor since 1866, and we know a thing or two about what makes a great G&T. Our bartenders pour with a generous hand (none of those stingy measures here!), and our comfortable spaces ‚Äì from the lively bar to the peaceful beer garden ‚Äì give you the perfect backdrop for your botanical adventure.

  

Dogs are welcome (they might enjoy the botanical aromas too!), families feel right at home, and with **free parking**, popping in for a quick G&T couldn't be easier. Located just **7 minutes from Heathrow Terminal 5**, we're perfect for **airport staff** finishing shifts or travelers starting their holiday early with a premium Botanist G&T!

  

## **Make July Your Botanist Month**

At just ¬£2.78 for a single or ¬£5.55 for a double (that's 25% off!), July is the perfect time to discover why gin lovers go wild for The Botanist. Each G&T is a little taste of the Scottish wilderness, served with a smile in the heart of Surrey.

  

## **A Little Botanist Education (For The Curious)**

Fun fact: The distillery uses a special still called "Ugly Betty" to make The Botanist. She might not be pretty, but she creates magic! The slow distillation process means all those 31 botanicals get to properly infuse their flavours into the spirit. The result? A gin that's complex enough to impress the experts but smooth enough for everyone to enjoy.

  

## **Come In and Enjoy The Botanist Gin**

No need to book, no special events to remember ‚Äì just brilliant gin at brilliant prices, available every single day throughout July. Whether it's a Tuesday afternoon pick-me-up or a Saturday night celebration, The Botanist is waiting for you.

  

## **Visit The Anchor This July**

Pop in and discover why The Botanist has gin lovers going wild! With our warm welcome, dog-friendly spaces, and relaxed atmosphere, we're the perfect spot for your July G&T adventures.
