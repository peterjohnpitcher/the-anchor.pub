## A Village that Embodies Peace

Stanwell Moor Village is more than its human inhabitants; it's a naturally beautiful space too. From the local fishing lake‚Äîa dog-walking favourite‚Äîto the idyllic Moors perfect for a Sunday picnic, there's beauty at every turn. The Stanwell Moor Residents Association often organises community clean-ups. Most recently, we all pitched in for a 'big clean-up' to celebrate the coronation of the King and Queen. Participants were afterwards treated to a well-deserved meal at The Anchor, making it a community event through and through.
