On April 19th, 2024, The Anchor and the Stanwell Moor community came together to celebrate Earth Day, focusing on making a substantial impact against pollution. The day was filled with community spirit and a shared commitment to beautify our village. Thanks to the enthusiastic participation of local residents and businesses, we successfully collected almost 75 bags of rubbish, significantly enhancing the aesthetic and appeal of our village.

  

The event concluded with a delightful outdoor lunch provided by The Anchor, where participants enjoyed the sunshine and a well-deserved break. This gathering not only celebrated our day's efforts but also sparked new friendships and professional connections among local business people, all united in their dedication to improving Stanwell Moor.

  

The feedback from participants was overwhelmingly positive, praising the well-organised activities and the opportunity to contribute meaningfully to our environment. As we look forward to future initiatives, we remain inspired by the passion and energy demonstrated by everyone involved.

  

Stay tuned for more as we continue to discuss upcoming environmental projects with the Stanwell Moor Residents Association. We are eager to maintain this momentum and further our impact.

  

Thank you to everyone who participated and made Earth Day 2024 a resounding success. Your efforts have not only made a significant difference but have also highlighted the strength of our community. We look forward to your continued support and engagement in future events.
