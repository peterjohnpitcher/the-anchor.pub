## Dancing, Drinks, and Shot Paddles

As the evening rolled on, the dance floor came alive with the beats of our live DJ, who kept the music flowing from 8 pm to 1 am. The energy was electric, with people dancing, laughing, and letting loose on the floor. This celebration wasn’t just about music; it was about everyone coming together, from strangers to neighbours, to enjoy an evening filled with joy and freedom.

  

The bar was bustling with excitement as guests enjoyed our popular shot paddles, perfect for sharing with friends and keeping the night’s energy high. This selection of shots added a fun element to the evening, with everyone toasting and celebrating together.

Throughout the night, guests could fuel up with delicious late-night bites, including takeaway-style burgers that added to the laid-back, fun vibe of the celebration. This kept spirits high and ensured everyone had the energy to dance until the very last song!

  

## **A Month of Festivities Leading to the Grand Finale**

The Day of the Dead Halloween Party was the closing event in a month filled with fun, themed gatherings that brought people together at The Anchor. Each event added its unique twist, building anticipation for the big night on November 2nd. Here’s a quick look back at our October highlights:

*   **Quiz Night:** On October 9th, we kicked off with a Halloween-themed Quiz Night, hosted by the ever-entertaining Nish. Teams competed on spooky trivia, and friends enjoyed the first of many nights celebrating the season together.
    
*   **Tequila Tasting Night:** Friday, October 18th was all about flavour and culture with our Día de Muertos-themed Tequila Tasting Night. Guests explored premium tequila selections, enjoyed a taco meal, and dived into the traditions of Day of the Dead through cocktails, quizzes, and engaging videos.
    
*   **Gameshow House Party:** On October 30th, we hosted a Gameshow House Party: Snatch Phrase Edition! With drag bingo, Play Your Cards Right, and The Price Is Right, hosted by the fabulous Nikki Manfadge, it was an evening of laughter, games, and inclusive fun.
    

  

Each event brought our community together and gave everyone a reason to join the celebration, building the excitement and momentum that led to our incredible Day of the Dead Halloween Party.
