**Is Father's Day Always the Third Sunday of June?**

Yes, in the UK, Father's Day is traditionally celebrated on the third Sunday of June. This is an important day dedicated to honouring father's and father figures alike. This tradition, while not a public holiday, is firmly rooted in our culture, and we at The Anchor love to join in the festivities.

**When Did Father's Day Become Popular in the UK?**

The observance of Father's Day in the UK became more widespread in the late 20th century, around the 1970s. It's believed that the tradition was influenced by the American custom of Father's Day, which was officially recognised much earlier. Since then, this day has been celebrated with much gusto across the UK, with families coming together to express their love and gratitude to their father's.

**When Was the First Father's Day in the UK?**

While the exact year of the first Father's Day celebration in the UK is not definitively known, it is believed to have been influenced by the American Father's Day tradition which was first celebrated in the early 20th century. It's thought that the UK adopted this tradition in the 1970s, which has since been embraced and celebrated annually.

**Who Invented Father's Day?**

Father's Day was first introduced in the United States. A woman named Sonora Smart Dodd is credited with creating the holiday. She wanted to honour her father, William Jackson Smart, a Civil War veteran and single father who raised six children. The first Father's Day was celebrated in Spokane, Washington, on June 19, 1910. Over the years, the idea caught on, and the celebration of father's spread across the world, including to our shores here in the UK.
