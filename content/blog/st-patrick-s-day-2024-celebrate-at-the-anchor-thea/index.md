### Five Fascinating Facts About Saint Patrick

  

Who was Saint Patrick, and why does he capture our imagination centuries after his time? Here are five facts to ponder over a pint:

1.  **Not Irish by Birth:** Saint Patrick was actually born in Britain but was captured and taken to Ireland as a slave.
    
2.  **A Symbolic Shamrock:** He used the three-leaved shamrock to explain the Holy Trinity to the Irish, leading to its association with the day.
    
3.  **Saint Patrick's Blue:** Originally, blue, not green, was the color associated with Saint Patrick.
    
4.  **Escape and Return:** After escaping slavery, Patrick returned to Ireland to convert the Irish to Christianity.
    
5.  **A Legacy of Churches and Schools:** He's credited with founding over 300 churches and numerous schools in Ireland.
    

  

## The True Story Behind St Patrick's Day

  

In a blend of myth and history, St Patrick's Day roots lie deep in the heart of Irish culture.

  

### From Religious Observance to Global Phenomenon

  

Originally a day for spiritual renewal and offering prayers for missionaries worldwide, it has blossomed into a celebration of all things Irish. The transformation began in the 18th century when Irish immigrants in the United States started organizing parades and gatherings as a show of strength and connection to their roots. It wasn't long before St. Patrick's Day became a symbol of Irish culture and heritage, celebrated by people of all backgrounds.

## The Colourful Controversy: Orange on St Patrick's Day

  

While green is the color most associated with St Patrick's Day, wearing orange can be a contentious choice.

  

### A Historical Hue

  

The color orange holds deep historical significance in Ireland. It represents the Protestants, particularly the followers of William of Orange. In the context of Ireland's history of religious and political division, wearing orange on St. Patrick's Day, traditionally a Catholic holiday, can be seen as provocative. However, today, as we embrace a more inclusive society, the day has become a celebration of Irish culture as a whole, beyond past divisions.
