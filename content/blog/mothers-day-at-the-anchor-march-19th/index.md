## Where did Mothers Day originate from?

Mother's Day as we know it today began in the United States in the early 20th century. The holiday has its roots in a variety of early motherhood and maternal welfare celebrations, some dating back to ancient civilizations.

  

The modern holiday of Mother's Day as we know it, began with Anna Jarvis, who organized the first official Mother's Day celebration in 1908, in Grafton, West Virginia. She chose the second Sunday in May as the day to honor mothers, because it was the anniversary of her own mother's death.

  

The campaign to establish Mother's Day as a national holiday began in earnest in the United States, and in 1914, President Woodrow Wilson signed a bill officially establishing the second Sunday in May as Mother's Day.
