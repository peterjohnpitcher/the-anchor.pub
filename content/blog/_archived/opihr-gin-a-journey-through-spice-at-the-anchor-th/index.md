Gin has long been a staple of British pubs, but few brands take drinkers on a journey quite like **Opihr Gin**. Inspired by the **ancient Spice Route**, Opihr is a **bold and aromatic London Dry Gin** that delivers a **distinctly spiced profile**, setting it apart from traditional juniper-heavy gins.

  

This March, **The Anchor** is proud to feature **Opihr Gin as our Manager’s Special**, offering an **exclusive 25% discount throughout the month**. Join us to explore its rich flavours and enjoy our specially curated **Opihr serves and food pairings**.

  

## **What Makes Opihr Gin Unique?**

### **Opihr Gin’s Signature Botanicals and Their Origins**

At its heart, **Opihr Gin is a celebration of the Silk and Spice Routes**, the historic trading paths that connected Asia, the Middle East, and Europe. Every botanical in Opihr has been hand-picked from regions that played a pivotal role in the global spice trade.

*   **Black pepper from India** – Adding a subtle heat and depth to the gin.
    
*   **Cubeb berries from Indonesia** – A smoky, peppery note with hints of resinous sweetness.
    
*   **Coriander from Morocco** – Bright and citrusy, balancing the spice with a fresh, herbal quality.
    
*   **Ginger from Nigeria** – Providing a gentle warmth and underlying spice.
    
*   **Cardamom from India** – Contributing an aromatic sweetness with complex layers.
    
*   **Spanish orange peel** – Bringing a vibrant citrus element that lifts the spices.
    

  

This blend of **hand-selected ingredients** results in a gin that is **warm, rich, and intensely spiced**, offering a **unique alternative to more traditional gins**.

  

### **How The Ancient Spice Route Shaped Opihr Gin**

The name **Opihr** originates from an ancient trading port famed for its wealth of exotic spices. The brand embraces this heritage by curating botanicals from across the world to create a gin that **embodies adventure, history, and craftsmanship**.

  

Unlike other gins that lean heavily on floral or citrus elements, **Opihr balances its botanical mix with spice-forward notes**, making it an **exceptional choice for those who enjoy depth and complexity in their drinks**.

  

## **How to Enjoy Opihr Gin at The Anchor**

The Anchor is dedicated to **bringing high-quality spirits to our guests**, and Opihr is no exception. To truly appreciate its unique flavour, we have created a range of **recommended serves and food pairings** to help you get the best out of this **exceptional gin**.

  

**The Art of Pairing Opihr Gin with Food**

The warming spice and citrus balance in Opihr make it **an ideal companion for a range of dishes**, particularly those that feature **rich, savoury, or slightly sweet flavours**.

*   **Crispy Pork Belly** – The richness of slow-roasted pork with Bramley apple sauce complements the spicy notes of Opihr. A **Rhubarb & Raspberry Tonic serve** adds a refreshing contrast.
    
*   **Slow-Cooked Lamb Shank** – The deep, savoury flavours of our lamb shank pair beautifully with an **Opihr Negroni**, which enhances its richness with bittersweet complexity.
    
*   **The Garden Club Pizza (V)** – The roasted courgettes, caramelised onions, and mozzarella of this vegetarian favourite match well with an **Opihr & Fever-Tree Indian Tonic**, keeping the flavours crisp and fresh.
