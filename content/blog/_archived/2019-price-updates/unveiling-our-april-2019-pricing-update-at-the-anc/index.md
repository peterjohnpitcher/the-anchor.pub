As we approach the end of our first month at The Anchor, we have received an annual increase in our prices from the brewery, forcing our hand, in-turn, to increase the prices for our products.

  

As you've hopefully seen, we are making every effort to ensure that the standards and quality of the products we serve you all are improving day-by-day, we are committed to continuously improve them for all of our guests.

**What products will be changing?**

We will be increasing the price of our draught products by 15p per pint.

  

**What products will NOT be changing?**

To ensure that pricing remains fair across the board, we will be holding steady on prices for spirits. We will also be freezing the price of wine to their current level.

  

**Why are we making the changes so soon after taking over The Anchor?**

Unfortunately, our hand has been forced by an annual increase coming from the brewery, Greene King on April 1, 2019 across the board. If we do not pass the price increase on, we risk the level of service and quality we deliver to you all, which cannot happen under any circumstance.

  

If you have any questions about the increase or what it means for your favourite drinks, please give me a call or stop in to chat.

  

Many thanks,

  

Billy
