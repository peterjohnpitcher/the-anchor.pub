It feels like it's been an age, but the time has finally come to safely reopen The Anchor for us all to share!

  

  

Opening up comes with a few adjustments, but things are most definitely easier than it has been for some of the other pubs around so far. A few

  

key things to note:

1.  You are welcome to come inside, into the warm and enjoy your time with us in groups of up to six (or two households).
    
2.  Our hours of operation have changed to help us deliver the best service during the busiest times.
    
    1.  Monday: 16:00 to 22:00 (no food service)
        
    2.  Tuesday: 16:00 to 22:00 (food service from 18:00 to 21:00)
        
    3.  Wednesday 16:00 to 22:00 (food service from 18:00 to 21:00)
        
    4.  Thursday 16:00 to 22:00 (food service from 18:00 to 21:00)
        
    5.  Friday 16:00 to 00:00 (food service from 18:00 to 21:00)
        
    6.  Saturday 12:00 (noon) to 00:00 (food service from 13:00 to 19:00).
        
    7.  Sunday 12:00 (noon) to 22:00 (no food service)
        
3.  We are still obligated to provide table service, so we ask that you find a seat when you arrive. Our team will take care of you from there.
    
4.  If you're dining or drinking with us in the garden, you are welcome to come to the bar and place/pay for your order. We will deliver your drinks to your table still.
