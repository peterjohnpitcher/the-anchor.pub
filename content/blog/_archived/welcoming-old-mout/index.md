## What is Old Mout?

Old Mout was dreamed up in New Zealand’s Moutere Valley, over 65 years ago.

  

Inspired by the great outdoors, our epic landscapes have always been a playground for the naturally adventurous and an inspiration for our exotic fruit ciders. That’s part of the reason we want to keep nature at its inspiring best.

  

Today, we’re as passionate about making fruit cider as we were when we first started, and we’re bringing Old Mout and a little bit of Kiwi spirit to the UK.
