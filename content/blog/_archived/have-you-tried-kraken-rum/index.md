We're very excited to welcome Kraken Rum to the family here at The Anchor. It's a delicious, premium, dark rum originating from Trinidad and made from locally grown sugar cane.

The rum is aged for 1-2 years and blended with a mix of 11 spices, including cinnamon, ginger and clove. The bottle is styled after a Victorian rum bottle and branded with the Kraken sea creature.

To enjoy Kraken at its best, it should be served as a double, over ice with a squeeded wedge of lime, why not do more with it though?
