Hello to all of our lovely customers, we've missed you all during lock down but hope you've all stayed safe!

  

As of today, we've been closed for 84 days as a part of the government mandated lock down, it's been incredibly tough on all of our families, friends and customers but we're working towards what opening back up would look like in a safe way.

  

At the minute, we have been advised to "prepare the pub to open from July 4th 2020". At this point, the government have not confirmed that we'll be allowed to open on that day, but have stated that "the hospitality industry could start to reopen no earlier than July 4th".

  

We will continue to keep everyone updated as we hear more, and hope that everyone stays safe and well as we all start to rebuild a new "normal".

  

Take care and with love from the whole team here at The Anchor.

  

Billy
