At The Anchor **pub near Heathrow**, we're passionate about premium spirits and their stories. Our carefully curated tequila selection celebrates the rich Mexican tradition behind every bottle. Whether you're a tequila connoisseur or curious newcomer, discover the fascinating history of agave and tequila at our **traditional pub** in Stanwell Moor.

## The History of Tequila: From Ancient Agave to Your Glass at The Anchor

Tequila's journey from sacred agave plant to the premium spirits we serve at our **Staines pub** is a story worth savoring. Understanding this heritage enhances every sip of our carefully selected tequilas.

### Agave: The Sacred Plant Behind Our Premium Tequilas

The agave plant, revered by the Aztecs as the "tree of wonders," has been central to Mexican culture for millennia. At The Anchor, we honour this tradition by offering only **quality tequilas** made from 100% blue agave. 

The ancient Mexicans created pulque, a sacred fermented agave drink used in religious ceremonies. This milky beverage was believed to connect the earthly and spiritual realms - a tradition we respect in our thoughtful approach to serving tequila at our **pub near Heathrow Airport**.

### From Pulque to Premium Tequila: Evolution of Excellence

When Spanish colonizers introduced distillation in the 16th century, mezcal was born. In Jalisco, the blue agave (Agave tequilana) created unique flavours that became tequila. Today at The Anchor, we showcase this evolution with our selection of:

- **100% Agave Blancos** - Pure, unaged expressions
- **Reposados** - Rested in oak for smooth complexity
- **Añejos** - Aged for rich, sophisticated flavours
- **Premium Mezcals** - Tequila's smoky cousin

## Tequila Production: Understanding What Makes Our Selection Special

### The Jimadores' Art

Every premium tequila at our **Stanwell Moor pub** begins with skilled jimadores harvesting mature agave plants. These craftsmen, using traditional tools called coas, remove the spiky leaves to reveal the piña (heart) - some weighing over 100 pounds!

### Traditional Production Methods We Celebrate

1. **Cooking**: Piñas are slowly roasted in traditional ovens
2. **Crushing**: Extracting sweet agave juice using tahona wheels
3. **Fermentation**: Natural yeasts create unique flavour profiles
4. **Distillation**: Typically twice-distilled for purity
5. **Aging**: Time in oak creates our reposados and añejos

Visit The Anchor to taste the difference traditional methods make. Our knowledgeable staff can guide you through our tequila selection, explaining how each production step affects flavour.
