Need to plan a **Christmas get-together near Heathrow** without spending a fortune? The Anchor in Stanwell Moor is a cosy village pub five minutes from Terminal 5, ten minutes from Staines-upon-Thames, and easy for Ashford or Windsor teams. Here's how to make your celebration feel generous, festive and affordable.

## 1. Pick the best-value dates

- **Tuesday to Thursday** three-course dinners are just **£36.95 per person** and include Yorkshire puddings, pigs in blankets, herb-crusted triple-cooked roast potatoes, seasonal vegetables and signature gravy.
- Mid-week bookings also unlock the **complimentary coffee & mince pie perk**, so everyone gets a sweet finale without extra cost.
- Lock in the **Early-Bird free glass of Prosecco** by booking before 31 October – it adds welcome sparkle for no extra spend.

## 2. Share platters, not extra starters

Our **All the Trimmings sharing boards** feed four guests for **£11.95** and keep tables buzzing without ordering individual extras. An **XL board** covers eight guests for **£21.95** – perfect for hungry teams.

For relaxed evenings, switch to a buffet:

- **Festive Sandwich & Salad Buffet** from **£10.95pp** suits training days and lighter lunches.
- **Festive Premium Grazing Buffet** at **£16.95pp** layers charcuterie, cheeses and hot bites so no one misses the trimmings.

## 3. Pre-book smart drinks bundles

- **Bundle A** combines arrival Prosecco with coffee & mince pie for **£9.95pp**, counting toward the £45–£52 spend goal.
- **Wine bundle (2 bottles £39)** and **beer buckets (£27 for six)** keep pouring costs predictable.
- Hosting a mixed-age crowd? Add **unlimited kids' squash (£2.50 per child)** and invite grown-ups to pre-pay a bar tab with a sensible cap.

## 4. Make travel easy for the team

- Free on-site parking outside the ULEZ, plus space to leave cars overnight.
- Five minutes from Heathrow Terminal 5, fifteen from Terminal 2 landside – perfect for airline crews finishing a late turn.
- Ten minutes to Staines-upon-Thames and Ashford, so local offices can walk, taxi or rideshare.

## 5. Confirm early for the best slots

Popular Thursdays and Fridays fill quickly. Secure your preferred date with a **£10pp deposit for groups of six or more** and share your pre-order seven days out so the kitchen can prep.
