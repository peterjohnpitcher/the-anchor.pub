The Anchor pub in **Stanwell Moor** proudly supports Jason West's incredible 65-mile charity walk for his daughter Holly. Starting from our **traditional pub near Heathrow Airport**, this community event showcases the strength of our local village.

## Holly's Courageous Fight Against Cancer

At just 12 years old, Holly from our **Stanwell Moor community** was diagnosed with Rhabdomyosarcoma, a rare and aggressive childhood cancer. Now 13, Holly continues her brave battle with the loving support of family, friends, and neighbors from across **Staines** and surrounding areas.

Throughout Holly's treatment, **Momentum Children's Charity** has provided invaluable support, arranging respite breaks and bringing moments of joy during hospital stays. The charity's work has been a lifeline for the West family.
