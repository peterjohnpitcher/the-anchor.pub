# Blog Content Guide

This guide explains how to create and structure blog posts for The Anchor website.

## Directory Structure

Each blog post must have its own directory under `/content/blog/` with the following structure:

```
/content/blog/
├── your-blog-post-slug/
│   ├── index.md          (required - the blog post content)
│   ├── hero.jpg          (required - main hero image)
│   ├── image1.jpg        (optional - additional images)
│   ├── image2.jpg        (optional - additional images)
│   └── image3.jpg        (optional - additional images)
└── README.md             (this file)
```

## Creating a New Blog Post

### 1. Create the Directory

Create a new directory with a URL-friendly slug (lowercase, hyphens instead of spaces):

```bash
mkdir content/blog/my-new-blog-post
```

### 2. Create index.md

Every blog post must have an `index.md` file with the following frontmatter structure:

```markdown
---
title: "Your Blog Post Title"
description: "A brief description of your blog post (used for SEO and previews)"
date: "YYYY-MM-DD"
author: "Author Name"
keywords:
  - keyword one
  - keyword two
  - keyword three
  - keyword four
tags:
  - tag1
  - tag2
  - tag3
featured: false
hero: "hero.jpg"
images:
  - "image1.jpg"
  - "image2.jpg"
  - "image3.jpg"
---

# Your Blog Post Title

Your blog content goes here in Markdown format...
```

### Subsection Heading

**Bold text** for emphasis

*Italic text* for subtle emphasis

- Bullet point lists
- Another bullet point

1. Numbered lists

```

### Best Practices

1. **SEO Optimization**:

   - Include relevant keywords naturally in the content
   - Use heading hierarchy (H2, H3) for structure

2. **Content Structure**:

   - Break content into scannable sections
   - Use subheadings every 2-3 paragraphs
   - Include a call-to-action at the end

3. **Images**:
   - Optimise images for web (compress, appropriate dimensions)
   - Use descriptive filenames (e.g., `botanist-gin-special-offer.jpg`)
   - Ensure hero image is eye-catching and relevant
