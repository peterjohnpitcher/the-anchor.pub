## **Experience a Caribbean Adventure Near Heathrow Airport**

Step into the warmth and rhythm of the Caribbean without leaving Surrey. Our **Rum Tasting Night** at The Anchor in **Stanwell Moor**, just **7 minutes from Heathrow Terminal 5**, is more than just a drinks event‚Äîit's a celebration of flavour, community, and culture, all under the cosy roof of our village pub. Whether you're a **Heathrow worker** seeking after-shift entertainment, a **Staines resident** exploring premium spirits, or travelers near the **airport** wanting authentic experiences, this night promises to awaken your senses and spark new connections.

  

## **What to Expect at Our Rum Tasting Night Near Terminal 5**

### **A Warm Welcome and Vibrant Atmosphere**

The evening kicks off at 7 PM with a tropical welcome drink in our beautifully decorated Private Dining Room. Caribbean-themed d√©cor sets the tone for a night of relaxation and fun, creating a truly immersive experience. Expect a room filled with vibrant colours, island beats, and the unmistakable buzz of community spirit. With **free parking** available, getting here from anywhere around Heathrow is easy.

  

### **Guided Tasting Journey with Expert Insights**

Led by Peter Pitcher, a passionate connoisseur, the guided tasting introduces six carefully chosen rums‚Äîeach offering a unique insight into the heritage and craft of Caribbean distilling. Learn about:
- **Premium aged rums** from Jamaica, Barbados, and Trinidad
- **Tasting notes** and proper sipping techniques
- **Food pairings** and cocktail suggestions
- **Distillery stories** and production methods

Compare this to airport duty-free shopping - here you'll actually understand what you're drinking!

  

### **Flavours of the Caribbean: A Themed Supper**

Midway through the evening, enjoy a hearty Caribbean-inspired meal. Our menu features:
- **Jerk chicken** with authentic spices
- **Rice and peas** cooked traditional style
- **Fried plantain** golden and sweet
- **Vegetarian alternatives** ensuring everyone is included

This reflects The Anchor's commitment to diversity and inclusivity in our multicultural **Heathrow community**.

  

## **The Joy of Shared Moments and Island Culture**

### **Test Your Knowledge with a Caribbean Quiz**

The night continues with a lively themed quiz that blends fun facts about rum with cultural gems from the Caribbean‚Äîmusic, food, geography, and more. It's a chance to laugh, learn, and maybe even win a prize as you connect with fellow attendees over shared smiles and spirited answers.

  

### **Shake Things Up in Our Cocktail-Making Session**

To close the night, you'll step behind the bar (metaphorically!) and get hands-on in crafting your own Caribbean cocktail. Learn to make:
- **Classic mojitos** with fresh mint
- **Authentic daiquiris** properly balanced
- **Rum punches** with tropical fruits
- **Dark 'n' Stormy** with real ginger beer

You'll leave with new skills‚Äîand perhaps a new favourite drink to impress friends!
