![What is Stanwell Moor](/content/blog/what-makes-stanwell-moor-a-lovely-little-village/hero.png)

It’s probably fair to say that the last couple of years has been difficult for everyone. Some of us have lost loved ones, some have been poorly with the terrible virus that ravaged our country. If one good thing has come out of the pandemic, it’s that it’s brought people together to support, love and care for one another in their hour of need.

  

As a small business, it’s been challenging to provide continuity of services to the people in our community. We’ve struggled to secure the necessary products that people love on multiple occasions and have had to get creative with communicating our message of togetherness.

  

We are not alone in that plight. We are one of many customer serving businesses in Stanwell Moor that ensure we all have a wonderful place to live and share. In a world where businesses are closing all the time, we all survive on our friends, family, and neighbours’ kindness and loyalty.

  

Our little village is made a village by our shared services, whether it’s for shopping and post office services from T5 Stores, somewhere clean and friendly to wash our clothes at the laundrette, a treat take away from Polash Tandoori, nails and sunbeds from Tallulahs, or a drink and something lovely to eat at The Anchor we all enjoy at least one of the services local to us all within walking distance.

  

Personally, we’ve seen other similar villages, like ours, turn into nothing more than a collection of houses because of the social and service hubs that make it disappear one day without notice. We all found a home in Stanwell Moor because of the community surrounding us. Our house prices are hinged on that spirit of the village continuing.

A note from our local Councillor, Jim McIlroy:

> It's a difficult time for all businesses in the current climate. Still, I'm confident in the resilience and tenacity of local business people to make it through the challenges with the support packages proposed by the Government and custom from local people.

> As a resident of Stanwell Moor I focus my efforts on best representing our interests and maintaining a close-knit community. Whether in partnership and discussion with Heathrow or smaller efforts to protect our streets and resident parking, I am here for you all.

> So, I implore the local community to continue supporting our small businesses in their plight to maintain our much-needed services and protect our way of life. I support them and I would ask residents to buy local and help protect the interests of our community.

> Councillor Jim McIlroy
