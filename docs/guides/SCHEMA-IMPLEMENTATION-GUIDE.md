## Technical Implementation Tips

### 1. **Create Schema Templates**
```typescript
// lib/schemas/faq-templates.ts
export const createFAQSchema = (questions: FAQItem[]) => ({
  "@context": "https://schema.org",
  "@type": "FAQPage",
  "mainEntity": questions.map(q => ({
    "@type": "Question",
    "name": q.question,
    "acceptedAnswer": {
      "@type": "Answer",
      "text": q.answer
    }
  }))
})
```

### 2. **Dynamic Schema Generation**
```typescript
// For events from API
export const generateEventSchema = (event: Event) => ({
  "@context": "https://schema.org",
  "@type": "Event",
  "name": event.name,
  "startDate": event.startDate,
  "location": {
    "@type": "Place",
    "name": "The Anchor",
    "address": {
      "@type": "PostalAddress",
      "streetAddress": "Horton Road",
      "addressLocality": "Stanwell Moor"
    }
  },
  "offers": event.offers ? {
    "@type": "Offer",
    "price": event.offers.price,
    "priceCurrency": event.offers.priceCurrency,
    "availability": event.offers.availability
  } : undefined
})
```

### 3. **Schema Validation**
- Use [Google's Rich Results Test](https://search.google.com/test/rich-results)
- Validate with [Schema.org Validator](https://validator.schema.org/)
- Monitor in Google Search Console

### 4. **Multiple Schema Implementation**
```typescript
// Combine multiple schemas on one page
<script type="application/ld+json">
{JSON.stringify([
  organizationSchema,
  localBusinessSchema,
  faqSchema,
  offerSchema
])}
</script>
```

## Measurement & Monitoring üìä

### Track Performance:
1. **Search Console**
   - Monitor rich results appearance
   - Track schema errors/warnings
   - Review enhancement reports

2. **Analytics**
   - Featured snippet clicks
   - Voice search traffic (mobile)
   - "Near me" query performance

3. **SERP Features**

## Next Steps
