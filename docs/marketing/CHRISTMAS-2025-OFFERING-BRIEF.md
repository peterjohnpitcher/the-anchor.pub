## 16. Gap Analysis – Existing /christmas-parties Page
| Current Element | Location | Issue vs Brief | Required Alignment |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Metadata + hero focus on Heathrow parking and £38 headline | `app/christmas-parties/page.tsx:10-68` | Messaging is airport-oriented with obsolete “from £38pp” pricing; lacks emphasis on village-pub positioning, Tue–Thu vs Fri–Sat tier, and table promise. | Reframe copy around village Christmas experience, community groups, and accurate pricing grid (£36.95/£39.95) with décor promise.
| “Christmas Party Venue Near All Heathrow Terminals” section | `app/christmas-parties/page.tsx:79-112` | Terminal distance grid is irrelevant to the 2025 brief audiences (local families, clubs). | Replace with section showcasing audience use-cases (mid-week work dos, families, community nights) and menu highlights.
| Bronze/Silver/Gold packages with 2025 placeholder | `app/christmas-parties/page.tsx:114-194` | Package pricing, inclusions, and availability conflict with set-menu offer; copy references unpublished 2025 menu. | Swap for Festive Menu overview, upsell table (Trimmings Boards, Bundle A, drinks bundles), and buffet pathway callout.
| Drinks & Entertainment upsell pricing | `app/christmas-parties/page.tsx:197-273` | Lists products (all-inclusive drinks, magicians, DJs) not in current proposition; omits mandated upsells. | Present add-ons per brief (Trimmings Board, pigs in blankets, etc.) and drinks bundles with accurate pricing.
| Parking comparison module | `app/christmas-parties/page.tsx:277-344` | Over-indexes on Heathrow cost-saving; not part of key messaging. | Condense into single supporting point within broader “Why choose us” grounded in generous portions, décor, community vibe.
| “Why choose us over hotels” grid | `app/christmas-parties/page.tsx:346-413` | Focused on Heathrow and ULEZ savings rather than value, generosity, décor, and capacity callouts. | Rebuild to echo positioning pillars: generous roasts, included trimmings, flexible spaces, warm service, mid-week value.
| Booking terms card (deposit £250 etc.) | `app/christmas-parties/page.tsx:417-469` | Deposit, balance, and timelines do not match brief; missing pre-order, cancellation, service charge notes. | Update to £10pp deposit rules, pre-order deadlines, 72h confirmations, 10% service charge, table times.
| Offers card (Sept 30 discount, January parties) | `app/christmas-parties/page.tsx:450-466` | Contains outdated incentives; misses early-bird Prosecco, mid-week perk, group perk, January bounce-back voucher. | Replace with current offers aligning to KPIs and add CTA for early booking.
| Related links emphasising non-seasonal pages | `app/christmas-parties/page.tsx:474-532` | Links to beer garden/Sunday roast; misses conversion aids like downloadable menu, enquiry form, FAQ anchor. | Update to menu PDF (or anchor), booking CTA, FAQ jump, buffet info.
| Schema markup advertising “from £38” airport packages | `app/christmas-parties/page.tsx:534-605` | Structured data misrepresents product, dates, and pricing; conflicting offers risk search penalties. | Regenerate schema for 2025 set-menu offering with accurate dates (late Nov–23 Dec), pricing tiers, upsell notes.

## 17. Renovation Plan – /christmas-parties Page

### 17.1 Page Architecture Refresh
- **Hero (fold)**
  - Rework metadata/hero copy to "A proper village-pub Christmas" value prop; add Tue–Thu / Fri–Sat price chips.
  - CTA stack: `Book your Christmas dinner` (BookTableButton) + `Download menu` secondary (PDF or anchor).
  - Microcopy: highlight crackers & décor promise + note on availability window (late Nov–23 Dec).
  - Keep secondary strap mentioning "free parking near Heathrow Terminal 5" and "outside the ULEZ" to retain existing organic intent keywords while reframing them within the village Christmas narrative.
- **Section 1: Guest Snapshot & Menu Promise**
  - Replace Heathrow distance grid with three tiles (Work parties, Families & friends, Community nights) each linking to relevant content anchors.
  - Add short paragraph summarising menu inclusions (Yorkies, pigs in blankets, seasonal veg, gravy).
- **Section 2: Menu Overview**
  - Two-column layout: menu choices (starters/mains/desserts) and kids pricing; include optional swaps/add-ons (cheeseboard, cheese course).
  - Embed price table (Tue–Thu £36.95pp; Fri–Sat £39.95pp; child pricing) with tooltip for dietary availability.
- **Section 3: Upsell Spotlight**
  - Feature Trimmings Boards with imagery; include per-person extras and drinks bundles in cards.
  - Add KPIs as subtle prompts (“Most tables add this” badges tied to targets).
- **Section 4: Offers & Incentives**
  - Grid outlining Early-bird (book by 31 Oct), Mid-week perk, Group perk, January voucher; include CTA to enquire now.
- **Section 5: Buffets & Alternative Pathway**
  - Introduce buffet options with bullet inclusions and call-to-action to download buffet sheet or contact for quote.
- **Section 6: Venue & Experience**
  - Carousel or split layout showing spaces (main bar, conservatory, garden) plus capacity notes.
  - Include table décor, crackers, and entertainment flexibility messaging.
- **Section 7: Booking Details & FAQs**
  - Summarise booking terms (deposit, pre-order timeline, final numbers, service charge, table duration, dietaries).
  - Pull FAQ accordions from section 15 to reduce scroll friction.
- **Closing CTA**
  - Reinstate ContactActions component but update copy to emphasise booking mid-week slots; include telephone + email + enquiry form link.

### 17.2 Copy & Asset Tasks
- Draft new copy aligned to tone: warm, generous, community-first; include plain-English explanations of upsells.
- Commission/resurface photography showing festive tables, trimmings boards, groups (check `public/images/events/christmas`).
- Create downloadable PDF/PNG of Christmas menu and buffet sheets for CTA.
- Build iconography consistent with value props (Yorkshire pudding icon etc.) if available in component library.

### 17.3 Technical & SEO Checklist
- Blend new copy with proven evergreen keywords ("Heathrow Terminal 5", "free parking", "M25 Junction 14") across H1/H2 and hero support text to sustain non-seasonal search performance.
- Update `<Metadata>` object with new title/description/keywords reflecting 2025 offer rather than Heathrow.
- Regenerate structured data to `Event` or `Menu` schema: dates from 2025-11-24 to 2025-12-23, pricing for Tue–Thu/Fri–Sat, include upsells as `OfferAddOn`.
- Ensure internal links support seasonal funnel: link to booking form, FAQs, buffet anchor, “What’s On” calendar.
- Add `noindex` guard removal if applied; confirm canonical remains `/christmas-parties`.
- Update open graph image to festive asset; ensure alt text references Christmas dinner with trimmings.

### 17.4 Operations & Sales Enablement
- Confirm POS codes and upsell PLUs ready before page goes live (ref. section 11).
- Embed Enquiry form integration or `BookTableButton` tracking to source `christmas_2025_page` for attribution.
- Include note on deposit policy within confirmation email templates (coordinate with CRM/booking system).
- Prepare downloadable pre-order sheet (CSV/PDF) featuring allergen flags and premium swap options; link from booking section.

### 17.5 Measurement & QA
- Define analytics events: hero CTA click, menu download, upsell bundle clicks, enquiry submissions.
- QA responsive layout (mobile-first) ensuring price grid readability and FAQ accordions accessible.
- Cross-check copy for accessibility (ARIA labels for accordions, high colour contrast for price chips).
- Pre-launch review with kitchen/FOH to validate menu accuracy and service flow descriptions.

### 17.6 Timeline & Owners
- **By 23 Sep 2025:** Finalise copy deck + photography selection (Marketing lead).
- **By 27 Sep 2025:** Design/implementation in Next.js components with staged preview (Digital team).
