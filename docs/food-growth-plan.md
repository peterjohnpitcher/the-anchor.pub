# Food Performance Growth Plan

**Objective:** Drive bookings from food-related searches by lifting impressions ‚Üí clicks ‚Üí conversions for core food URLs (`/food-menu`, `/sunday-lunch`, `/pizza-tuesday`, supporting offer pages).

**Baseline (GSC 28d ending 2025-10-12):**
- `/food-menu` variants: 11 clicks / 1,974 impressions, CTR <1.3% despite positions 5‚Äì8.
- Strong intent queries (‚ÄúSunday roast near Heathrow‚Äù, ‚ÄúTuesday pizza deals‚Äù) show impressions with low CTR or rankings >10.
- Duplicate hostnames (`the-anchor.pub` vs `www`) splitting page signals.

| URL | Clicks | Impressions | CTR | Avg. Position |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| `https://www.the-anchor.pub/food-menu` | 4 | 1,406 | 0.28% | 7.68 |
| `https://the-anchor.pub/food-menu` | 7 | 568 | 1.23% | 4.95 |
| `https://www.the-anchor.pub/sunday-lunch` | 26 | 696 | 3.74% | 6.50 |
| `https://www.the-anchor.pub/pizza-tuesday` | 1 | 327 | 0.31% | 13.60 |
| `https://www.the-anchor.pub/food/pizza` | 0 | 168 | 0.00% | 14.77 |

**High-value query clusters (top 10 each)**
- **Roast:** `sunday roast near heathrow airport` (2 clicks, 20 impressions, position 3.55) ‚ñ∏ `sunday roast heathrow airport` ‚ñ∏ `roast dinner near me` ‚ñ∏ `sunday roast near me` (0 clicks, 27 impressions, position 13.81).
- **Pizza:** `tuesday pizza deals` (0/30/12.67) ‚ñ∏ `bogof pizza near me` (0/13/7.38) ‚ñ∏ `urban pizza stanwell moor` (0/19/6.05) ‚ñ∏ `pizza buy one get one free near me` (0/22/31.95).

## Dependencies & Risks

- **Tracking before optimisation:** GA4 event schema must be live before CTA tests (Phases 2 & 6) so results can be measured; prioritise GTM updates once canonical work is approved.
- **Canonical + sitemap:** Search Console submission depends on redirect updates; coordinate with dev ops to execute in off-peak window and monitor for crawl errors.
- **Content sequencing:** Heathrow layover landing page should publish ahead of support blogs to unlock internal linking; ensure design assets are ready one week prior.
- **Media capture:** Video/social proof tasks require coordination with kitchen schedule; lock filming dates to avoid slipping Phase 5 timelines.
- **Resource bandwidth:** Same dev resource spans canonical fixes, performance tuning, and GTM updates‚Äîalign sprint planning to avoid bottlenecks; consider contractor support if timelines compress.
- **External promotion:** GBP/social calendar relies on finalised Pizza Tuesday/Sunday Roast copy; content team to deliver drafts at least three days before scheduled posts.
