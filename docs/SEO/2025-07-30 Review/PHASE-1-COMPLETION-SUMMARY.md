## Key Findings

### ‚úÖ Safe to Proceed
1. **Redirects**: All are for decommissioned pages - NO changes needed
2. **Event-details**: Confirmed old URL pattern - safe to keep redirects
3. **Location pages**: All 8 exist but are orphaned (no internal links)
4. **Heathrow pages**: All 5 exist but missing critical transport info
5. **Backups**: Created for all critical files

### üö® Critical Issues Found
1. **robots.txt blocks /drinks/** - This blocks active content including:
   - Main drinks menu page
   - Manager's Special promotional page
   
2. **Location pages are orphaned** - 8 high-value pages with zero internal links

3. **Heathrow pages missing transport info**:
   - No taxi information (¬£25 from terminals)
   - No bus 442 information
   - Missing terminal-specific timings

### ‚ùì Questions Requiring Clarification
1. **Taxi pricing discrepancy**: Master reference says "¬£25" but earlier docs mentioned "¬£8-10". Which is correct for Heathrow taxi content?
