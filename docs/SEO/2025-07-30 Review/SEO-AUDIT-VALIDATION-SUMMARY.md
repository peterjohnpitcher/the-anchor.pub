- **Actual increase: 93.5%** (very close to claimed 92.4%)

**Issue Found:**
The audit summary states "92.4% increase in clicks (79 → 152)" but the actual GSC data shows:
- 31 → 60 clicks (93.5% increase)
- The numbers 79 → 152 appear to be incorrect or from a different time period

- **Average CTR improved**: Calculated at ~0.44% overall
- **Total queries tracked**: 1,433

- Consistently showing high impressions with minimal/zero clicks
- Average position 35-50 (too low for clicks)

## 4. Key Discrepancies Found

### 1. Traffic Numbers Mismatch
- Audit claims 79 → 152 clicks
- Actual data shows 31 → 60 clicks
- Percentage increase is similar (92.4% vs 93.5%)
- Suggests possible data source confusion

### 2. Impressions Trend
- Audit doesn't mention the 5.4% decrease in impressions
- This is concerning as it suggests visibility is declining despite more clicks

### 3. Heathrow Performance Gap
- Massive search volume opportunity confirmed (39.6M searches/month)
- But current performance is essentially zero
- 76 queries tracked but no meaningful traffic
- Validates the opportunity but highlights execution urgency

## 6. Recommendations Based on Validation
