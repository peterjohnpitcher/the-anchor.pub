### 4. Content Performance Insights
**What Works**
- Service/experience pages (dining, events, facilities)
- Location-based content
- Event-specific pages (high CTR when found)

**What Doesn't Work**
- Individual product pages
- Generic blog content
- Non-local focused content

### 5. Technical Observations
- Average position of 29.8 indicates significant optimization potential
- Many pages with impressions but zero clicks suggest meta description issues
- Mobile "near me" searches showing strong intent but need optimization

## Strategic Implications

1. **Location-First Strategy**: The data clearly shows location + service intent dominates
2. **Experience Over Products**: Customers search for experiences (beer garden, Sunday lunch) not products
3. **Terminal Specificity Matters**: Generic "near Heathrow" isn't enough - need terminal-specific content
4. **Quick Win Potential**: Many pages ranking 10-20 could easily move to top 5 with optimization

## Recommended Focus Areas
1. Heathrow terminal-specific landing pages
2. Meta description optimization for high-impression pages
3. Local schema markup enhancement
4. Review generation for social proof
5. Mobile experience optimization
