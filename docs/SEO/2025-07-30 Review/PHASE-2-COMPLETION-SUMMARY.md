## Next Steps: Phase 3

**IMPORTANT QUESTION BEFORE PROCEEDING**:

The master reference guide states taxi costs from Heathrow are "Around Â£25", but earlier SEO documents mentioned "Â£8-10". Which price should I use when adding transport information to the Heathrow pages in Phase 3.1?

Please clarify the correct taxi pricing before I proceed with content optimization.
