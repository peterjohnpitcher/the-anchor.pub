# The Anchor Lean Paid Media Plan - ¬£250/Month Budget
*Maximum Impact Strategy for Limited Budget*

## Executive Summary

With ¬£250/month, focus 100% on Meta Ads (Facebook/Instagram) for maximum reach and targeting precision. Forget Google Ads - too expensive for this budget level.

### Budget Allocation: ¬£250/month

**Single Platform Focus**: Facebook/Instagram ONLY
- No budget fragmentation

### TACTICAL BOOST: Event Promotion (¬£25/month - 10%)

**Strategic Boosting Only:**
- Boost organic event posts that get traction
- 3-day boost before major events

## Geographic Targeting Strategy

### Forget Broad - Go Hyperlocal

**Primary Targets (in priority order):**

2. **Staines town center** - Specific postcode
3. **Heathrow Hotels** - Pin drop targeting:
   - Premier Inn T5
   - Sofitel
   - Holiday Inn
4. **Ashford** - 2 mile radius

**Why This Works:**
- Lower competition = cheaper clicks
- Higher relevance = better conversion
- Community building = repeat customers

## The Creative Strategy That Converts

### Photo Priorities for ¬£250 Budget

**Must Have (5 photos total):**
1. **The Money Shot**: Your absolute best Sunday roast plate
2. **The Yorkshire**: Giant Yorkshire pudding (people love these)
3. **The Pizza**: Best looking pizza with visible toppings
4. **The Atmosphere**: Beer garden with plane overhead
5. **The Social Proof**: Busy dining room/happy customers

### Image Optimization Rules
- Add text overlays yourself (free on Canva)
- Include prices on images
- Show portions clearly (size sells)
- Natural light only
- Phone photos are fine if sharp
