# Google My Business Posting Guidelines for The Anchor

## Overview
This document provides comprehensive guidelines for creating optimized Google My Business (GMB) posts that improve local SEO visibility and drive customer engagement.

## Core Principles

### 1. Always Include Location
Every post MUST mention our location to improve local search visibility:
- Primary: "The Anchor Stanwell Moor"
- Secondary: "Surrey" or "near Heathrow"
- Never just say "Join us" - always "Join us at The Anchor Stanwell Moor"

### 2. Leverage Heathrow Proximity
Our USP is being 7 minutes from Heathrow Terminal 5:
- Include in 2-3 posts per week minimum
- Use variations: "7 mins from Terminal 5", "near Heathrow Airport", "perfect for airport stopovers"
- Target airport-related searches

### 3. Consistent Contact Information
Every post should include:
- 📞 01753 682707
- 📍 Location reference
- ⏰ Relevant times
- 💷 Prices (where applicable)
