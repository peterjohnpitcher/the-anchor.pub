# Book Table Page Issues - Summary

## Issues Found and Fixed

### 1. ✅ 404 Error for /api/business/hours (FIXED)
- **Problem**: The API was trying to call `/api/business/hours` but the correct endpoint is `/api/business-hours`
- **Solution**: Updated `getBusinessHours()` in `/lib/api.ts` to use the correct endpoint

### 2. ✅ React "asChild" Prop Warning (FIXED)
- **Problem**: Button component was using `asChild` prop which isn't implemented
- **Solution**: Restructured the markup to wrap Button with anchor tag instead

### 3. ✅ Kitchen Closure Message Improvement (FIXED)
- **Problem**: When kitchen is closed, only showed "No times available" without explanation
- **Solution**: Added prominent message box that shows:
  - The reason why no times are available (e.g., "No kitchen service on Mondays")
  - For Mondays specifically, added a message that the bar is open for drinks with phone number

### 4. ❓ No Booking Times Showing (NEEDS INVESTIGATION)
The booking times generation appears correct in the code:
- Times are generated based on kitchen hours from the business hours API
- Kitchen hours are:
  - Tuesday-Friday: 6pm-9pm
  - Saturday: 1pm-7pm
  - Sunday: 12pm-5pm
  - Monday: No kitchen service

**Possible issues to check:**
1. Verify the business hours API is returning data in the expected format
2. Check if the day names are correctly lowercase in the API response
3. Verify kitchen hours object structure matches what the code expects

## Other Errors Noted

### Web Vitals Messages (Not Errors)
The "INP" messages are performance metrics, not errors. They show good performance ("rating: good").

### Image Optimization Warnings
Several warnings about using `<img>` instead of Next.js `<Image>` component. These are performance suggestions, not breaking errors.

## Next Steps

To debug the booking times issue:
1. Check the browser's Network tab to see what the `/api/business-hours` endpoint returns
2. Add console.log statements to see:
   - What `businessHours` contains after fetching
   - What `dayOfWeek` is being calculated
   - What `dayHours` contains for the selected date
   - What `kitchenStatus` is determined to be

The code logic appears correct, so the issue is likely with the data format or the day name matching.
