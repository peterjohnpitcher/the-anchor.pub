## Addressing Deposit Concerns

### Messaging Framework

**Never Say**:

- "Must pay deposit" (negative framing)
- "No-shows cost us money" (our problem, not theirs)

**Always Say**:
- "£5pp deposit ensures fresh ingredients"
- "Deposit guarantees your table"
- "Small deposit keeps quality high, prices fair"
- "Your £5pp deposit comes off the bill"

### Copy Variations Testing

**Week 1-2: Quality Focus**
"£5pp deposit means we buy fresh just for you"

**Week 3-4: Exclusivity Focus**
"Limited tables - £5pp deposit secures yours"

**Week 5-6: Value Focus**
"Deposit keeps our roasts affordable at £14.95"

**Week 7-8: Freshness Focus**
"We order ingredients after Saturday 1pm deadline"

## Scheduling Strategy

### Weekly Spend Distribution

**Monday**: £10 (Awareness - plant seed)
**Tuesday**: £15 (Awareness - build interest)
**Wednesday**: £20 (Consideration - midweek reminder)
**Thursday**: £25 (Traffic - booking intent)
**Friday**: £35 (Traffic - urgency)
**Saturday (8am-1pm)**: £15 (Conversions - final push)
**Sunday**: £0 (They're here or they're not)

**Weekly Total**: £120
**Monthly Total** (avg 2.1 weeks): £250

### Time of Day Optimization

**Thursday-Friday**:
- 9am-10am (work browse)
- 12pm-2pm (lunch decisions)
- 5pm-8pm (weekend planning)

**Saturday**:

- 10am-11am (main push)
- 12pm-12:45pm (absolute final)

## Retargeting Strategy

### Audience Segments

- Target Monday-Tuesday
- Message: "Time for another perfect Sunday?"

**Segment 3: Saturday Missers**

- Target following Monday
- Message: "Book early for next Sunday"

## Landing Page Requirements

- Test video of carving/plating

### If Hitting Deposit Resistance

**Soft Approach**:
- "Deposit comes off your bill"
- Show value: "£5 secures £40+ meal"

**Incentive Approach**:
- "Book 4+ people, one deposit waived"
- "Regulars program: No deposit after 3 bookings"

## Success Metrics

### Minimum Success (Must Hit)
- 12 bookings/week via ads
- £20 cost per booking
- 60% show rate

### Target Success (Aim For)
- 20 bookings/week via ads
- £12 cost per booking
- 85% show rate

### Exceptional Success (Stretch)
- 30 bookings/week via ads
- £8 cost per booking
- 95% show rate

## Monthly Reporting

### Track & Report
1. Total ad spend vs bookings
2. No-show rate (proves deposit value)
3. Average party size
4. Repeat booker percentage
5. Saturday morning conversion rate

## The Psychology That Sells

### Key Principles

1. **Scarcity**: "Limited tables available"
2. **Social Proof**: "Locals' favorite Sunday roast"
3. **Loss Aversion**: "Don't miss this week's roast"
4. **Commitment**: "Deposit = investment in quality"
5. **Urgency**: "Deadline approaching"

### Message Evolution

**Monday**: Information (what, where, when)
**Tuesday-Wednesday**: Consideration (why us)
**Thursday**: Decision (should I book?)
**Friday**: Urgency (running out of time)
**Saturday AM**: Scarcity (last chance)
