# Private Hire Package Recommendations for The Anchor

## Executive Summary
Based on market research of UK pub private hire pricing in 2024-2025, I recommend a tiered package structure with minimum spend requirements rather than room hire fees. This aligns with industry standards and makes packages more attractive to customers.

## Market Context
- London pubs typically charge £500-£1500 minimum spend
- Surrey pubs often have no hire fee, just minimum spend
- Food packages range from £10-60 per head depending on service style
- Midweek bookings can offer 30-50% lower minimum spends

## Recommended Package Structure

### 1. "The Local" - Small Gatherings
**Capacity:** Up to 25 guests
**Minimum Spend:** £400 (weekday) / £600 (weekend)
**Per Head Estimate:** £16-24

**Includes:**
- Reserved area for 3 hours
- Welcome drink on arrival
- Choice of:
  - Finger food buffet (£10 per head)
  - Pizza sharing platters (£12 per head)
- Dedicated server
- Basic decorations (balloons/banners if requested)

**Why This Works:**
- Low entry point attracts smaller celebrations
- £400 minimum = just £16 per head for 25 people
- Still profitable with typical 65-70% gross margin on drinks

### 2. "The Celebration" - Standard Package
**Capacity:** 26-50 guests
**Minimum Spend:** £750 (weekday) / £1000 (weekend)

**Why This Works:**
