# Performance Optimization Research Findings

## 1. Image Optimization Research

### Next.js 14 Image Component Best Practices

**Key Findings:**
- The `priority` prop is CRITICAL for LCP images - can reduce LCP by 62%
- Sharp is integrated by default for image processing
- Modern formats (WebP, AVIF) are automatically served
- Responsive images via `srcset` are generated automatically

**Proven Results:**
- One case study showed LCP improvement from 4044ms â†’ 1510ms (62% reduction)
- Another showed 75% reduction in image payload
- Speed Index improvements of 24% average

**Implementation Requirements:**
1. Add `priority={true}` to hero/LCP images
2. Use proper `sizes` attribute for responsive loading
3. Quality between 75-85 is optimal for web
4. Implement blur placeholders for perceived performance
5. Only preload LCP images, not all viewport images

### Image Preprocessing Strategy

**Tools:**
- Sharp for Node.js preprocessing
- @squoosh/lib for build-time optimization
- Plaiceholder for blur data generation

**Optimal Settings:**
- Hero images: 82-85 quality
- Thumbnails: 75-80 quality
- Multiple format generation (WebP + AVIF + fallback)

## 2. Critical CSS Research

### Current State in Next.js 14

**App Router Limitations:**
- No built-in critical CSS extraction for App Router
- `experimental.optimizeCss` only works with Pages Router
- Manual extraction required for App Router apps

**Tools Available:**
1. **Critters/Beasties** (most efficient)
   - Shortest extraction time
   - Easy integration
   - Maintained fork of deprecated Critters

2. **Critical** (by Addy Osmani)
   - More features but slower
   - Better for complex layouts

**Performance Impact:**
- 700-800ms FCP improvement on mobile (p90)
- Eliminates render-blocking stylesheets
- Must keep critical CSS under 14KB compressed

### Implementation Strategies

**For Static Sites:**
- Straightforward implementation
- Can analyze and modify at build time
- Better results overall

**For Dynamic Sites:**
- Background optimization on first visit
- Cache critical CSS for subsequent visits
- Runtime overhead considerations

## 3. Edge Deployment & CDN Research

### Vercel Edge Network Features (2025)

**Architecture:**
- Global edge nodes functioning as micro data centers
- Anycast routing to nearest node
- Intelligent caching algorithms

**Performance Features:**
1. **Partial Prerendering (PPR)**
   - Static shell from CDN
   - Dynamic content streamed
   - Best of SSG + SSR

2. **ISR at Edge**
   - Selective page section refresh
   - Minimized latency
   - Reduced server load

3. **Smart Routing**
   - Continuous traffic monitoring
   - Dynamic request routing
   - Pre-emptive resource allocation

**Real-World Impact:**
- Sub-100ms response times globally
- 300ms global content updates
- Automatic scaling during traffic spikes

### Edge Function Optimization

**Use Cases:**
- Third-party script proxying
- A/B testing at edge
- Geolocation-based content
- Request transformation

**Configuration:**
```javascript
export const runtime = 'edge'
export const revalidate = 3600
```

## 4. JavaScript Optimization Research

### Modern JavaScript Delivery

**Polyfill Elimination:**
- ES2020 as compilation target
- Modern browser detection
- Conditional polyfill loading

**Bundle Optimization:**
1. **Code Splitting**
   - Route-based splitting automatic
   - Component-level with dynamic imports
   - Vendor chunk optimization

2. **Tree Shaking**
   - Remove unused exports
   - Optimize library imports
   - Dead code elimination

**Build Configuration:**
- SWC minifier (faster than Terser)
- Remove console logs in production
- React property removal

## 5. Emerging Techniques (2025)

### Next.js 15 Features
- Stable PPR (Partial Prerendering)
- Enhanced ISR with `expireTime`
- Improved edge runtime performance

### AI-Powered Optimizations
- Predictive prefetching
- Smart resource prioritization
- User behavior-based optimization

### WebAssembly Integration
- CPU-intensive tasks at edge
- Image processing in browser
- Reduced JavaScript payload

## 6. Monitoring & Analytics

### Key Metrics to Track
1. **Core Web Vitals**
   - LCP, FCP, CLS, INP
   - Real user monitoring (RUM)
   - Synthetic monitoring

2. **Business Metrics**
   - Bounce rate correlation
   - Conversion impact
   - User engagement

### Tools Recommended
- Vercel Analytics (built-in)
- Web Vitals library
- Custom performance marks
- Lighthouse CI

## 7. Common Pitfalls to Avoid

1. **Over-optimizing images** - Quality below 70 hurts UX
2. **Excessive preloading** - Bandwidth competition
3. **Too much inline CSS** - Prevents caching
4. **Aggressive code splitting** - Network overhead
5. **Ignoring mobile performance** - 60% of traffic

## 8. Quick Wins

1. Add `priority` to LCP image - immediate impact
2. Enable SWC minifier - faster builds
3. Update browserslist - remove polyfills
4. Implement blur placeholders - perceived performance
5. Configure proper cache headers - repeat visits

## Conclusion

The research shows that achieving 90+ PageSpeed score is achievable through:
1. Aggressive image optimization (biggest impact)
2. Critical CSS extraction (significant for FCP)
3. Edge deployment optimization (global performance)
4. Modern JavaScript delivery (reduced payload)

Expected improvements: 50-80% LCP reduction, 30-50% overall score increase.
