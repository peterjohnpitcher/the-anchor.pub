# Local SEO Implementation Plan - The Anchor

## Before We Start - Information Needed

### 1. Google Business Profile Status
**Question**: Do you have access to your Google Business Profile (formerly Google My Business)?
- If YES: I'll create content and instructions for you to implement
- If NO: We need to claim and verify it first (critical priority)

### 2. Review Incentive Policy
**Question**: Are you comfortable offering incentives for reviews? (e.g., monthly draw for reviewers)
- This affects our review acquisition strategy

### 3. Location Priorities
**Question**: Which location pages should we prioritize?
- Stanwell (your immediate village)
- Ashford (10 minutes)
- Windsor (20 minutes)
- M25 Junction 14
- Heathrow Hotels

**Question**: Any specific messaging or claims you want to avoid or emphasize?
