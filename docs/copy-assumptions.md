## Review Process

1. **Content scan** – Before publishing, search for “pre-order”, “express”, “guarantee”, “always” and similar absolutes.
2. **Ops check** – Run new claims past the duty manager or kitchen lead; record the outcome in this register.
3. **Quarterly audit** – Re-review ⚠️ items at least once a quarter or when operational policies change.
