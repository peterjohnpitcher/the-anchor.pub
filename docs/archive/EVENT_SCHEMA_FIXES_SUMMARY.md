# Event Schema Fixes Summary - 2025-07-18

## Overview
Comprehensive fix for Google Search Console event schema validation errors. All hardcoded event schemas have been replaced with the EventSchema component to ensure consistent and complete schema implementation.

## Changes Made

### 1. Enhanced static-events.ts
- Updated `createRecurringEvent` function to include all required Event interface fields
- Added proper `@type` fields for all nested objects
- Added `location` field with complete address including country
- Added `organizer` field with default values
- Added `offers.url` field
- Added new static events:
  - `privateParties` - For private party bookings
  - `dragShows` - For monthly drag shows
  - `quizNight` - For monthly quiz nights
  - `bingoNight` - For monthly bingo events

### 2. Replaced Hardcoded Schemas

#### /app/private-party-venue/page.tsx
- Removed hardcoded `privatePartySchema` object
- Added import for EventSchema and staticEvents
- Now uses: `<EventSchema event={staticEvents.privateParties} />`

#### /app/corporate-events/page.tsx
- Removed hardcoded `corporateEventSchema` object
- Added import for EventSchema and staticEvents
- Now uses: `<EventSchema event={staticEvents.corporateEvents} />`

#### /app/christmas-parties/page.tsx
- Removed hardcoded `christmasEventSchema` object
- Added import for EventSchema and staticEvents
- Now uses: `<EventSchema event={staticEvents.christmasParties} />`

#### /app/whats-on/drag-shows/page.tsx
- Removed hardcoded Event schema in JSON-LD script
- Added import for EventSchema and staticEvents
- Now uses: `<EventSchema event={staticEvents.dragShows} />`

#### /app/whats-on/page.tsx
- Removed entire EventSeries schema with hardcoded subEvents
- Added individual EventSchema components for each event type:
  - `<EventSchema event={staticEvents.dragShows} />`
  - `<EventSchema event={staticEvents.quizNight} />`
  - `<EventSchema event={staticEvents.bingoNight} />`
- Kept the FAQ schema separate

## Key Improvements

1. **Consistency**: All events now use the same EventSchema component
2. **Complete Data**: EventSchema component has proper fallbacks for all required fields
3. **Maintainability**: Event data is centralized in static-events.ts
4. **Validation**: All events now include:
   - performer (with fallback to "The Anchor Entertainment")
   - organizer (with fallback to "The Anchor")
   - image (with fallback to venue exterior)
   - offers (with all required subfields)
   - eventStatus (always "EventScheduled")
   - eventAttendanceMode (always "OfflineEventAttendanceMode")
   - location (with complete address including country)
   - endDate (calculated from startDate if missing)
   - description (with fallback text)

## Verification Steps

1. ✅ Build completed successfully
2. ✅ All hardcoded schemas replaced
3. ✅ EventSchema component verified to have all required fields
4. ✅ Static events updated with complete data

## Next Steps

1. Test all event pages with Google's Rich Results Test tool
2. Monitor Google Search Console for validation improvements
3. Ensure any new events added use the EventSchema component
4. Consider adding more event types to static-events.ts as needed

## Files Modified

- `/lib/static-events.ts` - Enhanced with complete event data
- `/app/private-party-venue/page.tsx` - Uses EventSchema
- `/app/corporate-events/page.tsx` - Uses EventSchema
- `/app/christmas-parties/page.tsx` - Uses EventSchema
- `/app/whats-on/drag-shows/page.tsx` - Uses EventSchema
- `/app/whats-on/page.tsx` - Uses multiple EventSchema components

All changes ensure that every event rendered on the site has complete, valid structured data that meets Google's requirements for event rich results.
