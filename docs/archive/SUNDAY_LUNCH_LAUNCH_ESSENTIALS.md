### 8. ‚è∞ Saturday Reminder SMS
"Hi John, reminder: Your Sunday lunch is booked for tomorrow 1pm. Party of 6. Any issues? Call 01753 682707"

## Nice-to-Have (But Really Useful)

### 9. Time Slot Capacity
Instead of just "50 total", set per slot:
- 12:00 - 60 people max
- 1:00 - 60 people max  
- 2:00 - 30 people max
- 3:00 - 20 people max

### 10. Dietary Memory
For repeat customers:
- Remember allergies
- Pre-fill on next booking
- Build customer profiles

## Why These Matter

**Without emails**: Customers anxious, manager uninformed
**Without SMS**: 5-10% no-show rate
**Without cancellation**: Angry customers, bad reviews
**Without admin dashboard**: Kitchen chaos, missed allergies
**Without review system**: Missing huge marketing opportunity

## Quick Wins You Haven't Mentioned

1. **WhatsApp Integration** - Many prefer WhatsApp to email
2. **Table Preferences** - Window, quiet area, near toilets
3. **Corporate Bookings** - Invoice option for businesses
4. **Special Occasions** - Birthday/anniversary field
5. **Weather Contingency** - Bad weather cancellation policy

## My Strong Recommendations

1. **Launch with SMS** - It's cheap and prevents so many issues
2. **Manager emails are critical** - They need to know immediately  
3. **Reviews at 6pm same day** - Better than 4 hours (they're home and relaxed)
4. **Print-friendly kitchen view** - Essential for busy service
5. **Phone number prominent** - Some people will always need to call

Ready to build? This system would be genuinely impressive!
