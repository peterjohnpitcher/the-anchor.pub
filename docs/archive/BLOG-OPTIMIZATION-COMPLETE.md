## Summary of Changes

Successfully implemented all recommendations from the blog optimization analysis. Here's what was completed:

### 1. Fixed Truncated Slugs (31 posts)
- Fixed all blog slugs that were cut off mid-word
- Examples:
  - `5-star-tequila-tasting-night-at-the-anchor-an-unfo` → `tequila-tasting-events`
  - `cash-bingo-at-the-anchor-win-50-at-our-monthly-bin` → `monthly-cash-bingo`
  - `the-ultimate-guide-to-the-british-chip-shop-experi` → `fish-chips-guide`

### 2. Optimized Long Slugs (30 posts)
- Shortened overly long URLs for better SEO
- Removed redundant words like "the-anchor", dates, and filler words
- Examples:
  - `the-importance-of-being-dog-friendly` → `dog-friendly-pub`
  - `celebrate-father-s-day-at-the-anchor-unforgettable` → `fathers-day-celebration`
  - `monthly-music-bingo-nights-great-food-prizes-and-f` → `music-bingo-nights`

### 3. Standardized Tags Across All Posts
- Created consistent tag taxonomy with primary categories
- Consolidated similar tags (e.g., `dogs` → `dog-friendly`, `offers`/`deals` → `special-offers`)
- Added primary category tags where missing
