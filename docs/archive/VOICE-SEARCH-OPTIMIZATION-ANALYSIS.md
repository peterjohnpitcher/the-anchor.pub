# Voice Search Optimization Analysis - The Anchor Pub Website

*Analysis Date: January 2025*

## Executive Summary

The Anchor pub website has a **prepared but undeployed** speakable schema implementation. While the schema exists in `/lib/enhanced-schemas.ts`, it's not actively used on any pages. This analysis identifies key implementation requirements and provides a strategic roadmap for voice search optimization.

## Current State Analysis

### 1. Speakable Schema Status

**✅ Prepared Components:**
- Speakable schema defined in `/lib/enhanced-schemas.ts`
- Basic structure targeting key CSS selectors:
  - `.hero-title`
  - `.opening-hours`
  - `.contact-info`
  - `.special-offers`

**❌ Missing Implementation:**
- No pages currently implement the speakable schema
- Schema not integrated into page components
- No voice-optimized content strategy
- Limited conversational keyword usage

### 2. Pages That Would Benefit Most from Voice Search

Based on common voice queries for local businesses, these pages should be prioritized:

#### **Tier 1 - Critical Pages (Immediate Implementation)**
1. **Homepage** (`/`)
   - "What are The Anchor's opening hours?"
   - "Is The Anchor open now?"
   - "Does The Anchor have parking?"

2. **Find Us** (`/find-us`)
   - "How do I get to The Anchor from Heathrow?"
   - "Where is The Anchor pub?"
   - "Give me directions to The Anchor"

3. **Food Menu** (`/food-menu`)
   - "What's on the menu at The Anchor?"
   - "Does The Anchor serve food?"
   - "What time does the kitchen close?"

4. **What's On** (`/whats-on`)
   - "What events are on at The Anchor?"
   - "When is the next quiz night?"
   - "Are there any drag shows this weekend?"

#### **Tier 2 - High Value Pages**
5. **Terminal Pages** (`/near-heathrow/terminal-*`)
   - "Pub near Terminal 5"
   - "Closest pub to Heathrow Terminal 4"

6. **Special Offers** (`/pizza-tuesday`, `/drinks/managers-special`)
   - "Does The Anchor have any deals?"
   - "What's the Tuesday special at The Anchor?"

7. **Sunday Lunch** (`/sunday-lunch`)
   - "Does The Anchor serve Sunday roast?"
   - "What time is Sunday lunch?"

## Voice Search Best Practices for Local Pubs

### 1. Content Optimization Requirements

**Question-Based Content Structure:**
- Use natural language patterns
- Include common questions as headings
- Provide concise, direct answers (20-30 seconds of speech)

**Key Voice Query Patterns:**
```
- "Is [business] open now?"
- "What time does [business] close?"
- "How do I get to [business]?"
- "Does [business] have [feature/service]?"
- "What's the [menu/special] at [business]?"
- "Find me a pub near [location]"
```

### 2. Technical Requirements

**Schema Implementation:**
```javascript
// Enhanced speakable schema for voice optimization
{
  "@context": "https://schema.org",
  "@type": "WebPage",
  "name": "The Anchor Pub - Homepage",
  "speakable": {
    "@type": "SpeakableSpecification",
    "cssSelector": [
      ".opening-hours-summary",  // Quick hours info
      ".quick-answer",           // Direct answers to common questions
      ".contact-phone",          // Phone number for "call" actions
      ".directions-summary",     // Brief directions
      ".today-special"          // Current offers
    ]
  },
  "url": "https://the-anchor.pub"
}
```

**Content Markup Guidelines:**
- Use semantic HTML5 elements
- Add specific classes for speakable content
- Keep speakable sections under 250 words
- Avoid complex formatting in voice sections

### 3. Mobile Performance Requirements

**Current Status:**
- ✅ Viewport meta tag configured
- ✅ Responsive design implemented
- ✅ Mobile-first CSS approach
- ⚠️ Performance metrics need verification

**Voice Search Performance Targets:**
- Page Speed: < 3 seconds on 3G
- First Contentful Paint: < 1.8s
- Time to Interactive: < 3.9s
- Cumulative Layout Shift: < 0.1

## Implementation Steps

### Phase 1: Foundation (Week 1)

1. **Create Voice-Optimized Content Components**
   ```typescript

     schemaType = "Question" 
   }) {
     return (
       <div className="voice-section quick-answer">
         <h3>{question}</h3>
         <p>{answer}</p>
       </div>
     )
   }
   ```

2. **Implement Speakable Schema Helper**
   ```typescript
   // lib/voice-search-helpers.ts
   export function generatePageWithSpeakable(
     pageSchema: any,
     speakableSelectors: string[]
   ) {
     return {
       ...pageSchema,
       speakable: {
         "@type": "SpeakableSpecification",
