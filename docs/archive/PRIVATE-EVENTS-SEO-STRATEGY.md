# Private Events & Corporate Bookings SEO Strategy

## Executive Summary
Private bookings and corporate events are high-profit opportunities for The Anchor. Currently, we have one generic book-event page, but we're missing significant search traffic by not targeting specific event types and locations.

## Current State Analysis
- **Single Page**: `/book-event` - Generic private bookings page
- **Limited Keywords**: Only targeting broad terms like "venue hire" and "event space"
- **Missing Opportunities**: No dedicated pages for high-value searches like:
  - Corporate events near Heathrow
  - Christmas party venue Staines
  - Birthday party venue Stanwell Moor
  - Meeting rooms near Terminal 5
  - Team building venue Surrey
