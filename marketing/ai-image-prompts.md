## PRO TIPS FOR BETTER RESULTS:

### If images look too "stock photo":
Add: "candid, unposed, authentic moment, photojournalistic style"

### If lacking Christmas feel:
Add: "subtle Christmas decorations, festive but tasteful, December atmosphere"

### If too dark/moody:
Add: "bright and inviting, well-lit, golden hour lighting, warm and welcoming"

### To avoid AI artifacts:
Add: "photorealistic, no artifacts, natural proportions, anatomically correct"

### Platform-Specific Tips:
- **DALL-E 3**: Add "I need this for a LinkedIn ad, professional quality"
- **Midjourney**: Use "--no text,watermark,logos,signs,writing"
- **Stable Diffusion**: Add negative prompts: "text, logos, watermarks, bad anatomy"
