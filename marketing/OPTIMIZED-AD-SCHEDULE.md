# Optimized Ad Schedule for Limited Kitchen Hours

## üéØ The Strategic Challenge
With kitchen only open 3 hours on weeknights (6-9pm), 6 hours on Saturday (1-7pm), and 5 hours on Sunday (12-5pm), every ad pound must work harder.

---

## ‚è∞ OPTIMIZED SCHEDULING STRATEGY

### Core Principle: "Right Message, Right Time"
- **Awareness ads**: Run during browsing times (lunch, commute)
- **Decision ads**: Run 2-3 hours before service
- **Urgency ads**: Run during service with countdown messaging
- **Stop ads**: 30 minutes before kitchen closes
