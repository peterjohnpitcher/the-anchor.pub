# Meta Ads Manager Manual Setup Guide - The Anchor Food Campaign

## 📱 Complete Step-by-Step Setup Instructions for 2025 Interface

---

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: BUDGET TYPE DETERMINES SCHEDULING

### The Scheduling Problem:
**Meta Ads Manager ONLY allows time-of-day scheduling with LIFETIME budgets, not daily budgets.**

Since your kitchen has limited hours (6-9pm weeknights, 1-7pm Saturday, 12-5pm Sunday), you MUST use lifetime budgets to avoid wasting money on ads when you're closed.

### Your Options:

**Option 1: Lifetime Budgets (RECOMMENDED)**
- ✅ Can schedule specific hours (e.g., 6-9pm only)
- ✅ No wasted spend when kitchen closed
- ❌ Less flexible (must set end date)
- ❌ Must commit budget upfront

**Option 2: Daily Budgets + Manual Control**
- ❌ Ads run 24/7 (wastes money when closed)
- ✅ More flexible day-to-day
- 🔧 Workaround: Manually pause campaigns daily
- 🔧 Or use third-party tools like Revealbot

**Option 3: Hybrid Approach**
- Create 7 separate campaigns (one per day)
- Use daily budgets but manually activate each day
- Most work but most control

- **Saturday 1pm**: STOP Sunday roast ads (deadline)
- **4-6pm**: Peak booking window for dinner
- **11am-2pm**: Lunch browsing for dinner plans

### Final Budget: £600/Month (£140/week) - 4 Separate Campaigns

| Campaign | Purpose | Weekly Budget | Active Days | Daily Spend When Active |
|----------|---------|---------------|-------------|------------------------|
| **Tuesday Pizza** | BOGOF promotion | £45 | Mon-Tue | £22.50 |
| **Saturday Service** | Extended hours 1-7pm | £35 | Fri-Sat | £17.50 |
| **Sunday Roast** | Pre-order push | £35 | Wed-Sat AM | £8.75 |
| **Retargeting** | Warm traffic | £25 | All days | £3.50 |
| **TOTAL** | | **£140/week** | | **£600/month** |

### Why 4 Campaigns Instead of 1:
- ✅ **No creative confusion**: Pizza ads won't show on Sunday
- ✅ **Clear performance tracking**: Know exactly which day works
- ✅ **Targeted messaging**: Each ad perfectly matches its offer
- ✅ **Flexible budgets**: Can easily boost winning days
- ✅ **Still enough budget**: £17-22/day is workable for Meta

### Critical Success Factors:
- **Tuesday Pizza**: Your highest margin - gets biggest budget
- **Saturday**: Longest service hours - maximize opportunity
- **Sunday Roast**: Must stop Saturday 1pm - no exceptions
- **Retargeting**: Lower budget OK - warm traffic converts better
- **Skip Wed-Thu**: Lowest demand days - save budget for winners
