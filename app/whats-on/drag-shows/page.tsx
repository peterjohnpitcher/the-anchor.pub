                  and determination. The fishermen took one look at me and said "She's got the spirit of a

                  my journey to The Anchor has been nothing short of spectacular, darling. I've had more 
                  ups and downs than a bride's nightie, but here I am, still standing in 8-inch heels!

                    disco lights twinkling, and an atmosphere of pure celebration. Our drag shows have 
                    become legendary in the local area, with people travelling from Staines, Ashford,

                  Started performing at working men's clubs where the only thing harder than the

                  manager said I could perform if I helped with the washing up. Joke's on him - these

                  This place and these people - they're family now. Dysfunctional, chaotic, slightly
