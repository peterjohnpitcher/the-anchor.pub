                  <p className="mb-4">
                    For generations, Sunday lunch at the village pub has been a cornerstone of British 
                    life. At The Anchor, we honour this tradition with pride. Every Sunday, our kitchen 
                    starts early, filling the pub with the comforting aromas of roasting meat and fresh 
                    Yorkshire puddings rising in the oven. It's the smell that draws locals from their 
                    Sunday papers and brings families together around our tables.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Our Sunday roast isn't just a meal - it's a weekly ritual for many Stanwell Moor 
                    families. Grandparents, parents, and children gather here, creating memories over 
                    generous plates of perfectly roasted meat and all the trimmings. It's these moments 
                    that make a pub truly part of the community.
                  </p>

                  <p className="mb-4">
                    Our head chef takes Sunday roast seriously - perhaps too seriously, his wife might 
                    say! Each cut of meat is carefully selected from local suppliers, seasoned with 
                    herbs from our own garden when in season, and roasted to perfection. The vegetables 
                    are fresh, not frozen. The roast potatoes are par-boiled then roasted in goose fat 
                    until golden and crispy. The Yorkshire puddings? Made from scratch, naturally.
                  </p>
                  <p className="mb-4">
                    This attention to detail is why we introduced our pre-order system. By knowing 
                    exactly how many roasts we're serving, we can prepare each one fresh to order, 
                    ensuring every plate meets our exacting standards. It's more work for us, but 
                    the results speak for themselves.
