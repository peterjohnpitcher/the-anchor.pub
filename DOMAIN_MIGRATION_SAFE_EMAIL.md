# Safe Domain Migration: Wix to Vercel (Preserving Email)

This guide will help you migrate the-anchor.pub from Wix to Vercel while **keeping your email services intact** at Register.com.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT: Your Email Setup
You have email services configured with Register.com. We will ONLY change the website DNS records (www and @) and leave all email-related records untouched.

## Current Email Records to PRESERVE:
- **MX Records**: Keep as-is (for email delivery)
- **Mail server A records**: email, ftp, imap, mail, mx, pop, smtp, webmail (all the 66.96.x.x IPs)
- These ensure your email continues working without interruption

## Step 1: Verify Current Setup

Your current DNS shows:
- **www**: Currently set to "none" with Register.com Hosting
- **@ (root)**: Currently set to "none" with Register.com Hosting
- **Email services**: Multiple mail-related A records (KEEP THESE!)

## Step 2: Add Your Domain to Vercel

1. Log into your Vercel account
2. Go to your project dashboard
3. Click "Settings" ‚Üí "Domains"
4. Add your domains:
   - Add: `the-anchor.pub` ‚Üí Click "Add"
   - Add: `www.the-anchor.pub` ‚Üí Click "Add"
5. Vercel will show you DNS requirements (we'll modify these to preserve email)

## Step 3: Update ONLY Website Records at Register.com

### Option A: Using A Records (Recommended for Register.com)

Since you already have A records configured, this is the safest approach:

1. **Log into Register.com**
2. Go to "Advanced DNS Manager" for the-anchor.pub
3. Click "Edit A Records"
4. **Update ONLY these two records:**

   **For www:**
   ```
   Host: www
   TTL: 7200
   Numeric IP: 76.76.21.21
   ```

   **For @ (root domain):**
   ```
   Host: @ (None)
   TTL: 7200
   Numeric IP: 76.76.21.21
   ```

5. **DO NOT CHANGE** any of these email-related records:
   - email.the-anchor.pub (66.96.162.48)
   - ftp.the-anchor.pub (66.96.162.142)
   - imap.the-anchor.pub (66.96.162.142)
   - mail.the-anchor.pub (66.96.162.142)
   - mx.the-anchor.pub (66.96.140.142 & 66.96.140.143)
   - pop.the-anchor.pub (66.96.162.142)
   - smtp.the-anchor.pub (66.96.162.142)
   - webmail.the-anchor.pub (66.96.162.48)

### Option B: Using CNAME for www only

If you prefer, you can use CNAME for www subdomain:

1. Click "Edit CNAME Records"
2. Add:
   ```
   Alias: www
   Points to: cname.vercel-dns.com
   TTL: 7200
   ```
3. Then remove the www A record (but keep @ as A record pointing to 76.76.21.21)

## Step 4: Remove Old Wix Configuration

Since your current records show "none" for www and @, you likely don't have active Wix IPs. But double-check:
- Look for any A records with IPs like 23.235.33.229 or 23.235.47.133
- Look for any CNAME records pointing to wixdns.net
- Remove only these if found

## Step 5: Verify Domain in Vercel

1. After updating DNS, go back to Vercel
2. In Settings ‚Üí Domains, you should see your domains
3. Click "Refresh" next to each domain
4. Vercel will verify and provision SSL certificates (can take 5-60 minutes)

## Step 6: Testing Checklist

**Website Tests:**
- [ ] https://the-anchor.pub loads correctly
- [ ] https://www.the-anchor.pub loads correctly
- [ ] SSL padlock shows in browser
- [ ] All pages load properly

**Email Tests (CRITICAL):**
- [ ] Send a test email TO your @the-anchor.pub address
- [ ] Send a test email FROM your @the-anchor.pub address
- [ ] Check webmail still works at webmail.the-anchor.pub
- [ ] Verify email clients (Outlook, Mail app) still connect

## Step 7: Set Up Redirects

Since you're keeping the same domain, you mainly need to handle any Wix-specific URLs. Your `wix-redirects.json` file should handle these automatically.

## Timing & Best Practices

1. **Make changes during low email volume** (evening/weekend)
2. **DNS propagation**: 5-30 minutes typically
3. **Monitor email immediately** after changes
4. **Keep Wix active** for 48 hours as backup

## Troubleshooting

**Website not loading:**
- Clear browser cache
- Check DNS propagation at whatsmydns.net
- Verify you used IP 76.76.21.21 for both www and @

**Email stops working:**
- IMMEDIATELY revert the @ and www records back to "none"
- Double-check you didn't modify any email-related records
- Contact Register.com support if needed

**SSL errors:**
- Wait up to 1 hour for Vercel to provision certificates
- In Vercel, remove and re-add the domain if needed

## Quick Rollback Plan

If anything goes wrong:
1. Log into Register.com
2. Edit A Records
3. Change www and @ back to "none" with Register.com Hosting
4. Changes revert in 5-30 minutes

## Summary of Changes

You're ONLY changing:
- **www** A record ‚Üí 76.76.21.21
- **@** A record ‚Üí 76.76.21.21

You're NOT changing:
- Any MX records
- Any email/mail/smtp/pop/imap records  
- Any other services

This ensures your website points to Vercel while email continues through Register.com.

## Support Contacts

- **Register.com Support**: Available in your account
- **Vercel Support**: https://vercel.com/support
- **DNS Check**: https://mxtoolbox.com/ (to verify email records)

Good luck! Your email will stay safe with this approach. üöÄ
