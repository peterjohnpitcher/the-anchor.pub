*Date: January 2025*

## Executive Summary

This comprehensive SEO audit of The Anchor pub website (the-anchor.pub) focused on local SEO best practices, schema markup implementation, and site structure.

### Critical Issue: Opening Hours Schema
**üö® URGENT**: The LocalBusiness schema in `/lib/schema.ts` contains incorrect opening hours:

- Tuesday-Thursday shows 22:00 closing instead of 23:00
- Saturday shows 12:00 opening instead of 13:00
- Sunday shows 22:00 closing instead of 21:00

**Impact**: Customers may arrive when closed, damaging reputation and Google rankings.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Minor Issues:
- Multiple email addresses used (manager@, bookings@, events@, info@)
- Slight name variations in metadata ("The Anchor Pub" vs "The Anchor")

## 3. Local SEO Optimization

### Keyword Coverage Analysis:
- **"Heathrow"**: 3,404 occurrences - EXCELLENT
- **"Stanwell Moor"**: 157 occurrences - GOOD
- **"Surrey"**: 245 occurrences - NEEDS IMPROVEMENT
- **"TW19"**: Well integrated in structured data
- **"Near me"**: Strategic implementation in content

### Location-Specific Pages:
‚úÖ **Strong Implementation**:
- Dedicated terminal pages (/near-heathrow/terminal-[1-5])
- M25 Junction 14 targeting page
- Local area pages for Staines, Ashford, Feltham, Windsor

‚ùå **Issue**: 8 location pages are completely orphaned (not linked from anywhere)

### ‚úÖ Implemented:
- Google Places API integrated with proper credentials
- Dynamic review fetching (limited to 5 reviews by API)
- Real-time rating updates in schema
- Review badge in header with current rating
- Direct link to leave reviews on Google

### Recommendations:

- /stanwell-pub, /windsor-pub

#### Feature Pages (3):
- /drinks/managers-special

- /blog/tags

### Test Pages (6) - Should be excluded from indexing:
- /_api-diagnostics, /api-status, /api-test
- /components, /demo-header, /test-reviews

## 6. llms.txt Recommendation

### What is llms.txt?
A new standard (proposed 2024) for helping AI systems understand website content better. Similar to robots.txt but for AI models like ChatGPT, Claude, and Perplexity.

### Should The Anchor Implement It?
**YES** - Recommended for these reasons:
1. **Local Discovery**: AI tools increasingly used for "find a pub near me" queries
2. **Event Information**: Ensure AI accurately reports your events and opening hours
3. **Menu Details**: Help AI understand your food and drink offerings
4. **Future-Proofing**: Early adoption positions you ahead of competitors
