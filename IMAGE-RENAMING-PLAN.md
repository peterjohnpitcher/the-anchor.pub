## Selection Criteria

From your large collections (182 Nikki images, 128 tequila images), we should select:
1. **Sharpest, well-lit images**
2. **Happy customers visible**
3. **Venue atmosphere clear**
4. **Event branding visible**
5. **Diverse crowd representation**

## Square Crop Requirements

As requested, all images need to be square (1:1 ratio). Many of your current images appear to be various ratios. We'll need to:
1. Identify the focal point of each image
2. Crop to 1:1 maintaining the key subject
3. Ensure 1200x1200px minimum resolution

## Next Steps

Would you like me to:
1. Create a script to automatically rename the best images following this SEO structure?
2. Help you select the top 10-15 images from each category for the website?
3. Set up the image optimization pipeline (square crops, compression, WebP conversion)?

Your event photography is a major asset - it shows The Anchor as a vibrant, inclusive, entertainment-focused venue that sets you apart from traditional "quiet country pub" competitors!
